Facebook (Deprecated, could not fetch without a business license):
None or nothing valuable yet - Incredibly Facebookâ€™s coronavirus information (at least posted by real people and not officials) has much more memes and misinformation rather than real serious talking or data than Reddit. (#coronavirus tag always shows coronavirus memes) 

Instagram (Deprecated, not needed):
None or nothing valuable yet - Similar to Facebook, full of memes and really small amount of serious talking. (#coronavirus tag always shows coronavirus memes)

Youtube:
