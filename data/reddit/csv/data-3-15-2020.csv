1,mikebug,A number of western governments seem to have adopted the principle that If you restrict the amount of testing you reduce the number of cases you will find Eventually of course the numbers will explode and the Govts will wonder how that happened THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF THIS VIRUS IS TO DO MASS TESTING come on guys its not rocket science,238,2020-03-15 04:32:10
2,BillyBlueRanger,Our schools were shut down by order of the Governor last Friday Wisconsin and people on my fb are saying the community needs to get the kids together for activities while they are out of school While I understand the sentiment isn t the reason for closing the schools to not have the kids in large groups,200,2020-03-15 19:38:20

10,Trevorghost,At a certain point social distancing is not going to work without a comprehensive social safety net which the US doesn t have I understand that this virus is bad I also understand how stupid it is to call it a bad cold or downplay it However the United States is not ready for months upon months of isolation and bans closures At a certain point people facing complete and total economic ruin will be like Fuck it I don t want to live on the streets And return to work I think it s interesting to see how this plays out Not only from a viewpoint of the epidemiology but from the long term societal effects How do you deal with entire generations of school aged children being a year behind How do you deal with millions of people unemployed literally overnight,103,2020-03-17 03:10:08

13,turkeysub3000,Re reinfection this LA times article makes a few good points Many reinfections may not be reinfections at all It may be the result of initial false positives due to cross contamination false negatives after supposed recovery where the virus lay dormant or was not well detected and false positives for subsequent testing due again to cross contamination and other factors The only way to know if reinfection truly happened would be to sequence the genome of the virus in the initial positive and the subsequent positive If the virus mutated quickly enough this constitutes a reinfection Another factor is that some people s immune systems may not be functioning properly and the virus resurged in the body Many patients in Wuhan may have been discharged prematurely to make space in beds for new patients Reinfection so far has been observed as a rare event,68,2020-03-15 14:43:30

17,A_Kindly_Man,One of the more frustrating things is seeing all of the athletes and celebrities announcing their results Many of them are asymptomatic and still have access to testing meanwhile thousands of ordinary people who are symptomatic are turned away because of a shortage in tests My girlfriend has some symptoms but lacks a fever so she was turned away If she were tested and was found to have COVID she could get unlimited sick leave because it s a pandemic But since she can t get tested she has the choice to use her PTO or work through it Thankfully she can work from home so that s what she s been doing I m sure there are many like her who can t work from home and are out there potentially spreading the disease because they can t get tested Just a personal frustration to share,61,2020-03-18 03:32:15

45,MINImanGOTgunz,I m not sure if anyone will read this but be prepared for 4 or more hour waits at airports coming in from Europe My wife and I arrived at 8 pm last night to O Hare in chicago from london We didnt get through Customs and CDC until 12 30 am First they put everyone from Europe in a separate customs line which took over 2 hours to get through Then they sent us all to another separate line to once again give passports to a boarder patrol agent so he can type in your phone number and email address for who knows what reason This took another two hours Then they funnel you into a third line to speak with CDC people answer questions and get temperature checks At one point in the second line they halted our line for 45 minutes no one moved Shortly after for some reason they started putting people that were way behind us in the customs lines in a different CDC waiting line and then all of them started to go through before us who waited hours longer People were ready to riot yelling at boarder patrol asking why we weren t moving and other lines were Boarder patrol gave no answers to anyone and just kept saying that person is just doing what they re told their job and we dont have any better answers than you It was pure insanity Not to mention theyve got hundreds of people from Europe standing in queues for hours definitely represents a larger health risk than just letting people through more efficiently They also told us it was going to get worse as UK and Ireland will be joining the ban today So what I m saying is be prepared to spend 4 or more hours in line after you get off the planes Make arrangements with traveling home to hold off until you get through CDC checks If you get rerouted through one of the 13 airports doing this and have a connection flight elsewhere you will almost certainly miss it unless it s 5 hour layover There were many in our line that their connecting flights left before we made it through the first customs line The only good thing they did was walk up and down the lines offering water and small snacks But if you travel from Europe you may want to buy some extra food before leaving for the US because you wont be able to leave to get anything especially those with kids This is just a heads up from my experience last night and hope to just prepare everyone for what s to come the next few weeks,38,2020-03-15 12:27:29
46,hairy_butt_creek,I m a bit annoyed that the federal government is already speaking of bailing out industries in the hospitality segment It makes sense I guess considering our President came from the hospitality segment but IMO there are better ways to jump start the economy when this is all done Hospitality doesn t cause a good economy it s the result of a good economy Fix the fundamentals first and hospitality will fix itself The airlines were irresponsible with their Trump tax cut and instead of saving cash they purchased a ton of their own stock Now their stock is worth dick and they have no funds to see them through the crisis They re begging daddy Trump for billions of dollars on top of the billions he already gave them via unnecessary and stupid tax cuts The cruise lines well fuck them completely I don t care if they all go under They employee very few Americans flag their ships in foreign ports to avoid US taxes and regulations rely on slave labor to serve passengers and pollute the oceans and air like crazy Let each cruise line die The impact to American industry will be minimum The hotels They don t need a bail out Instead of handing the hotels billions in cash why doesn t the US government hand billions in cash to provide vouchers for people who are unable to pay rent The hotels can cash in those vouchers for money while providing a roof to the homeless Going forward most bailouts should filter through US citizens and not go directly to companies Instead of giving billions to various industries the government should give billions to US citizens in the form of vouchers cash debt forgiveness and so on so that money filters up instead of trickles down 100 billion for the auto industry No Here s 100 billion though in vouchers people can use towards the purchase of a new car,36,2020-03-17 12:25:20
