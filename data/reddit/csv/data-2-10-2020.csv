4,Kromulent,The reported caseload has gone nearly flat over the last couple of days I think the safest assumption is that this is a reporting error that either the data is held up or no longer being collected or that it is censored,83,2020-02-10 01:07:04
5,SublimeCommunique,So summary is that we still don t know much of anything and we should all be terrified or just ignore it following our natural inclination Is that about right,83,2020-02-10 01:08:47

10,Medicus2,Just attended a great grand rounds by an infectious disease specialist in the US who believes this coronavirus will become a community transmitted infection meaning it will gain a foothold in the community and will become an annual thing The scary part is that it is more contagious than the common flu based on its mechanism gains rapid entry via the ACE2 enzyme within the lung and the fact that the viral load in the respiratory tree is very high as early as 24 48hrs before symptoms present It s certainly not the end of the world We should all be more terrified of the flu which is all around us for most of the year But COVID 19 is definitely going to have a significant impact on our medical infrastructure primarily putting increased stress on our ICUs across the country A vaccine will be available in around 1 year and we will need approximately 80 immunization to achieve herd immunity within the community This will certainly not be easy to achieve The biggest takeaway that I got was that we have a small window of opportunity to nip this in the bud and we need to take advantage of it But if this virus does get out of control life will continue on It ll just be yet another respiratory virus that causes fevers and cough that we will have to deal with year after year Hopefully this virus will make antivaxxers realize that we don t get vaccines to protect ourselves but rather the sick and frail who are the ones that die when they become infected I m not going to bet my house on that though,51,2020-02-26 00:12:33

12,myasssmellslikefeets,CDC has to get any public statements cleared by Mike Pence now According to the New York Times,40,2020-02-27 21:55:23
13,EdwardNippleclamps,Corona Pro Tip When you re at work look at your co workers and say It s scary to think some of us aren t going to be around after this Corona stuff You ll basically ensure no one dies just so it can be extremely awkward after that and you look like a huge dumbass,37,2020-02-28 23:30:57
14,TerrisKagi,Complete moron shows up in an Uber to hospital with Corona virus enters through main doors,42,2020-02-13 19:04:03
15,MrK_HS,What I find the most interesting is just how the modern internet connected society deals with this stuff Some get into panic mode some try to gain money from it with ethically dubious practices some make conspiracy theories some make memes some don t care And these are all big self contained echo chambers with people sharing similar opinions just look at the misinformation on facebook I feel there is a lot to learn from this from a social standpoint Sometimes I think that being this connected could be detrimental for some people,40,2020-02-26 00:24:53
16,droppinkn0wledge,Panic is useless as is childish flippancy We should all be paying attention at this point If the CDC is advocating for people to be prepared we should listen especially when they say to expect significant disturbances in daily lives This is not going to cause an apocalyptic collapse of society but stringent quarantine procedures will be put in place in the event of an American outbreak This could restrict travel Schools could close temporarily Etc No one in America has experienced a quarantine like this So no not everyone is going to die But yes your life will be severely disrupted in the event of an outbreak here So you should be prepared,43,2020-02-26 18:37:08
17,TheKmank,The people saying that the seasonal flu is more deadly than COVID 19 are falsely equivocating the scope of both viruses Whilst it is true that Influenza in 2019 to 2020 will kill an estimated 41 000 people in the USA alone currently much higher than the less than 3 000 reported deaths worldwide for COVID 19 it is also important to remember that the seasonal flu infects an estimated 41 000 000 people a year in the USA source That means that 1 in every 1 000 people who get the seasonal flu die ie 0 1 of people COVID 19 on the other hand has an estimated fatality rate of 1 in every 100 people and that s a low estimate The COVID 19 virus is highly contagious and is rapidly spreading throughout the globe If COVID 19 became as widespread in the USA as Influenza the numbers of death would be quite different If the same 41 000 000 were infected within the year the estimated death toll would be 410 000 That s a death toll almost the size of Minneapolis The mortality rate combined with the virus high infection rate is why many people are worried about COVID 19 but there is more to it than that We have vaccines to help protect vulnerable old young sick etc people from Influenza which is decently effective at stopping the virus We do not as of yet have a vaccine to protect these people from COVID 19 and we probably wont have one for 12 to 18 months at best source This is why there needs to be a strong and rapid response to the COVID 19 outbreak and why it should be taken very seriously If the COVID 19 virus is allowed to run rampant on a global scale it will be devastating I haven t even mentioned the re infection rate of the disease the potentially long incubation period or the asymptomatic carriers of the virus Does that mean you should go full panic mode Probably not As of right now the best thing you can do is to keep updated and informed Know the ways to lower the risk of infection and take the threat seriously see The death toll might not be as big as Influenza right now but make no mistake COVID 19 has the potential to be a much greater threat to the world Edit 1 000 not 10 000,43,2020-02-27 13:01:51

20,OneWinkingBro,Maddow reporting that WaPo reporting that HHS Azar wasn t informed Trump was going to name Pence as the point man until moments before today s presser So when Azar said at the end that he s still the real point man and acted like he would just be informing Pence Azar doesn t really know that They were all just making shit up like a fucking community college improv group,37,2020-02-27 03:09:22

24,Gasonfires,Rachel Maddow presented an explanation Tuesday evening that in 2018 President Trump dismantled the US Government s epidemic preparedness and response apparatus for no more reason than that it was created by President Obama There is now no centralized response coordination in America In addition while the CDC was warning today that things could become intense and that large disruptions of American life are to be expected and should be planned for Trump and his economic adviser were trying to pump up the plummeting stock market with statements that the US has everything virus under control We are fucked Edit I am proud that the first response to this comment was a downvote It plainly came from a Trump supporter and that fact alone clearly proves their ignorance and refusal to acknowledge undeniable facts They just shit on them and pretend that makes them go away,33,2020-02-26 08:33:14

29,rapunzelsasshair,The scariest thing about pandemics to me is the fact that you can do everything right it doesn t matter if someone next to you does the wrong thing It s a very helpless feeling Some people will never take it seriously enough and they will potentially cost lives We need to all do the right thing and show a bit of evolved understanding and empathy for strangers This is the true test of humanity,34,2020-02-29 02:55:10

34,civicmon,Just got a NY Times news alert about a possible community transmission in California Person has no travel history to an affected country Edit before some tryhard says it s fake news because it s the NYT or tries to argue with me I m not an expert just passing along a relevant news article You be the judge C D C Confirms First Possible Community Transmission of Coronavirus in U S A case in California may be the first infection without a known link to travel abroad By Roni Caryn Rabin Feb 26 2020 7 55 p m ET A person in California who was not exposed to anyone with the coronavirus and had not traveled to countries in which the virus is circulating has tested positive for the new coronavirus representing what may be the first case of community spread here in the United States the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday At this point the patient s exposure is unknown a C D C statement said The case was detected through the U S public health system and picked up by astute clinicians Please check back for updates on this developing story,30,2020-02-27 01:10:22

38,muntaxitome,Please end this megathread this completely buries the news about the virus,31,2020-02-28 17:23:02
39,Whatsisthiscoin,It seems to me that Chinese cities with some of the worst air quality in the world high rates of cigarette smoking and a widespread culture of spitting in public spaces would be particularly well suited to both spreading COVID 19 as well as maximizing the worst outcomes of any respiratory illness That seems reasonable but I haven t heard any mention of any of this in any news coverage Anyone with any medical know how want to chime in Edit for clarity according to some 2015 data China has about 25 of its population smoking and I saw elsewhere that it was closer to 50 of the male population That is not the highest by of population for contrast the US is at 17 and Russia is 39 but given China s humongous population it represents a substantial proportion of the world s overall smokers,30,2020-02-20 16:42:39

41,CatOfTheDecade,It s always a good idea to be prepared for any disruption of normal whether it s due to a pandemic a severe storm system or even just an illness injury that makes getting out difficult Unfortunately a lot of the preparedness sites out there are filled with half literate political rants and delusional conspiracy theories and they can really turn off people who are just looking for advice So coming from someone who lives in the northeast and grew up losing power for 2 5 days at a time every few months here are some simple easy to follow things you can do right now to better prepare yourself for whatever x200B 1 Buy a little extra food Freeze dried stuff doesn t taste great but you can put it on a shelf and forget about it for the next 10 20 years Good brands include in no particular order Augason Farms Mountain House Wise Foods Backpackers Pantry MyPatriotSupply don t laugh and Chef s Banquet Also consider a backup way to boil water in case the power gas goes out Extreme budget options spam peanut butter crackers instant pancake mix canned soup canned chicken tuna beans honey 2 Think about water This can be as simple as filling a few jugs with tapwater Figure on one gallon per person per day If you want to get fancy there are lots of high quality filtration systems out there Sawyer Katadyn Lifestraw and Berkey are all good brands depending on your budget As much as I enjoy coffee from my local roasters I always keep a sealed jar of instant coffee on hand just in case Instant nothing 3 Remember your pets Always keep an extra unopened bag of food on hand Same with cans If you have cats do the same with litter 4 You ll want something to do Books are always the answer I like cheesy scifi anthologies but YMMV Movies and whatnot are great but think about a severe storm where the power internet cellular service might go out 5 Medicine If you have any prescriptions switch to a 90 day refill if you can DO NOT short your dosage to stretch it out Stock up on whatever you need to ride out a cold or flu aspirin ibuprofen acetaminophen day night flu medicine etc Ditto for any medicines your pet may need Remember by US law generics are always exactly the same active ingredient s as name brand Contrary to popular hysteria it s profoundly unlikely that this will result in the total collapse of all society as we know it HOWEVER it s good to think about what you d do in a real emergency Consider what would happen if your area lost power for 72 hours heat even gas furnaces would fail pipes would burst sewer systems would back up cell service would go down not all cell sites have generators water would go out cats and dogs living together mass hysteria What would you do There s no right answer for everyone it all depends on your budget needs and situation Thinking about it today is a lot better than trying to figure it all out in a real emergency A warning about 1 many freeze dried food vendors advertise based on how many meals a package contains Ignore this number it s just marketing fluff That meal might be only 200 calories with zero protein Instead look at the total number of calories you re buying Divide the price including shipping by the number of calories This allows you to directly compare brands Again it is profoundly unlikely that this will make any significant impact on your life But it s never a bad idea to think ahead and be prepared EDIT I m not saying freeze dried food tastes bad it s just not great At no point in your life will you ever go man I really wish I had some freeze dried lasagna instead of this fresh stuff But when the power s out on a cold winter day and you want something hot with minimal effort freeze dried stuff is much more filling than soup,32,2020-02-26 15:41:47

47,MMbasic,I m surprised there hasn t been more discussion of Smokers It appears smokers seem to have much more ACE 2 gene expression in their lungs for the virus to latch onto Would explain a lot Chinese men are some of the worlds worst best smokers The data on SARS and CorV2019 seems to hit men more than women As far as women well 2nd hand smoke and what not Children don t seem to be getting hit so hard a they don t smoke b haven t been around as long for genes to mutate express 2nd hand smoke air pollution etc I ve seen a little discussion regards to this but not much in the main stream news etc Air Pollution I have no data studies on this but I posit the terrible air pollution there would cause the same effect to happen with ACE 2 pathway Spitting That was is actually a cultural thing in China and is was a problem I m sure the CCP will pass a bunch of new codes regarding public spitting IIRC HK Shanghi Tiawan have long ago I maybe wrong on this Its probably not going to get discussed publicly or on a large scale because people will call it more racism and that s a shame But watch what the local codes and laws do with regards to public spitting after this is all over with Weather It still wintery Self explanatory Lunar New Year Large Dense Population Self explanatory Aged Population Due the one child policy of decades past China has a disproportional amount of older people And it would stand to reason if old eldery succumb to the disease easier that s an obvious reason why they re being hit so hard The demographics would explain a lot The quick burst of cases The almost non existent deaths in other infected countries 1 HK 1 Philpns and or lack of aggressive spread Other countries with not so great not sophisticated health care systems are not getting decimated This has been going on for a while now and I would posit been going on longer than we are were actually aware of it Everyone is looking for the virus and any possible infections everywhere Even in other parts of China outside of Wuhan Hubei doesn t seem all that terrible So there you go A perfect storm of demographics and circumstances,27,2020-02-11 17:12:52
48,Lapidoth,The coronavirus outbreak that s shuttered commerce across China will likely become a global pandemic a top U S health official said adding that it s just a matter of time before the outbreak starts spreading in the U S Current global circumstances suggest it s likely this virus will cause a pandemic Anne Schuchat principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters at a news briefing It s not so much a question of if this will happen any more but rather more a question of when this will happen and how many people in this country will become infected and how many of those will develop severe or more complicated disease she added Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar added We can t hermetically seal off the United States,25,2020-02-25 21:46:01

55,tiff_seattle,Health officials Dozens at Kirkland nursing facility reporting symptoms that might suggest coronavirus,28,2020-02-29 21:21:55
56,JigglymoobsMWO,A few things to remember The death rate based on confirmed case reports is likely to be much higher than the real per case fatality rate This is because confirmed cases over represent individuals with severe reactions to the virus For every person who shows up at the hospital with severe symptoms there is likely to be several or more who don t even realize they are infected A virus with a lower fatality rate is easier to spread and harder to contain for the precise reason that most human carriers are asymptomatic or have unalarming symptoms According to Dr Anthony Faucci director of the NAIID in the US his high level contacts in China have confirmed that asymptomatic transmission between persons is a certainty according to what Chinese health authorities are now observing on the ground The 1918 pandemic flu that killed tens of millions around the world had only a 1 fatality rate but infected nearly 40 of the world The current corona virus probably have an actual fatality rate some where between 0 1 normal flu season and 1 like the 1918 pandemic This makes it an exceptional public health threat The vast majority of the fatalities have been seen in the elderly or immune comprised individuals It does not seem to be a significant threat to healthy adults under age 50 or children As things stand it s still far too early to project whether the virus will be contained As it stands Chinese government efforts are probably slowing down the spread but may not fully contain it Coronaviruses tend to spread better during winter months when the combination of cold temperatures and humidity help preserve the virus During the warmer dryer months of the year viruses tend to spread less well This it s possible that if the spread of the virus is slowed enough the warming weather could help further slow the spread Vaccines are currently under development in the US and else where and maybe ready for wide deployment in about one year This is too slow to affect control efforts now but may be able to help by next winter One resource for those wishing to get understanding of the virus is a series of interviews by the Journal of the American Medical Association with Dr Anthony Faucci long time director of the NAIID at the NIH and one of the foremost virology experts in the US,26,2020-02-10 03:21:50
57,sensualharpy,If the virus is as contagious as people seem to be indicating is there a huge risk that when it starts appearing more in the US people who are symptomatic will not go to the doctor for any number of reasons can t get off work fear of losing job cost of healthcare and the biggest one fear that if they DON T have it they are going to go to a hospital and get infected by it especially as the numbers get larger If someone starts to feel like they might have it especially if their symptoms are mild won t they resist going to the doctor and try to tough it out at home and then infect other members of their family as it is apparently super contagious,26,2020-02-14 19:23:10

88,kenlane,Due to rapidly escalating health concerns relating to the spread of the coronavirus disease COVID 19 the 2020 APS March Meeting in Denver CO has been canceled This is a yearly meeting of about 10 000 physicists it is an institution of the community and has happened yearly since I don t even know when According to what I was told earlier this week the program was Swiss cheese at this point because nobody from Asia could travel x200B This cancellation comes on the night before most domestic attendees would be traveling to the conference which begins on Monday The question remains how Universities which often require graduate students and post docs to attend a conference to have travel reimbursed will handle the situation x200B As we all know graduate students in particular often pay cost for these conferences up front despite being paid far less than their skill set deserves If universities are not willing to reimburse students for a conference that didn t happen the economic impact could be devastating for those most hurt by the academic institutions we have constructed,24,2020-03-01 04:33:56
