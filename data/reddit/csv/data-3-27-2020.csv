23,SovietSunrise,Donald Hears a WHO On the fifth day of Feb in the district of C In the cool of the day watching Fox News TV He was laughing enjoying impeachment s great joys When Donald the President heard a small noise Donald it said You re a very fine chap But a virus is coming and it s a terrible trap It s too small to be seen and it s far worse than flu So please heed my warning for I am the WHO But Donald just laughed I ve not heard it said Of an invisible virus that s easily spread See here now WHO there s no need to whine I m sure that it will all be it will all be just fine So Donald went golfing no need to prepare For a mysterious virus that s not even there Listen he said I don t mean to boast But here in this country a few cases at most But the WHO kept on warning and at least in the states Some leaders decided Well prudence dictates That we listen to Science and accept with some Grace That we re all going to have to just shelter in place But Donald got angry and said Don t you see You re making it harder to reelect me Ignore the WHO sure the virus is here But soon like a miracle it will just disappear And Hannity said on his show Listen folks This whole virus thing is a liberal hoax Pretending that this thing is worse than the flu Is just liberals trying to persecute you So blue states and red states each went their way And the virus exploited every delay So for Donald and red team it was quite a surprise When the cases and body count started to rise So Donald went out and said on TV There s never been anyone better than me And despite all the insults that liberals lob 200K dead is a really good job Well said the WHO at least now you see That it would have been better to listen to me But Donald said Oh you foolish WHO I knew this was serious LONG before you My uncle taught Science and I have his genes That s why I was first to see what this all means So the WHO went home and wept in his bed For words have no meaning and irony s dead So from this story the lesson is clear Next time you see a disaster is near Know it will be an unavoidable mess Because conservative actions are easy to guess They ll mock you and scorn you and just say you re lying Right up until they finally start dying,29,2020-04-04 10:20:40

25,snormie,Some advice from a respiratory therapist They re older and retired so forgive grammar and spelling Since they are calling on Respiratory therapist to help fight the Corona virus and I am a retired one too old to work in a hospital setting I m gonna share some common sense wisdom with those that have the virus and trying to stay home If my advice is followed as given you will improve your chances of not ending up in the hospital on a ventilator This applies to the otherwise generally healthy population so use discretion 1 Only high temperatures kill a virus so let your fever run high Tylenol Advil Motrin Ibuprofen etc will bring your fever down allowing the virus to live longer They are saying that ibuprophen advil etc will actually exacerbate the virus Use common sense and don t let fever go over 103 or 104 if you got the guts If it gets higher than that take your tylenol not ibuprophen or advil to keep it regulated It helps to keep house warm and cover up with blankets so body does not have to work so hard to generate the heat It usually takes about 3 days of this to break the fever 2 The body is going to dehydrate with the elevated temperature so you must rehydrate yourself regulaly whether you like it or not Gatorade with real sugar or pedialyte with real sugar for kids works well Why the sugar Sugar will give your body back the energy it is using up to create the fever The electrolytes and fluid you are losing will also be replenished by the Gatorade If you don t do this and end up in the hospital they will start an IV and give you D5W sugar water and Normal Saline to replenish electrolytes Gatorade is much cheaper pain free and comes in an assortment of flavors 3 You must keep your lungs moist Best done by taking long steamy showers on a regular basis if your wheezing or congested use a real minty toothpaste and brush your teeth while taking the steamy shower and deep breath through your mouth This will provide some bronchial dialation and help loosen the phlegm Force your self to cough into a wet wash cloth pressed firmly over your mouth and nose which will cause greater pressure in your lungs forcing them to expand more and break loose more of the congestion 4 Eat healthy and regularly Gotta keep your strength up 5 Once the fever breaks start moving around to get the body back in shape and blood circulating 6 Deep breath on a regular basis even when it hurts If you don t it becomes easy to develope pneumonia Pursed lip breathing really helps That s breathing in deep and slow then exhaling through tight lips as if your blowing out a candle blow until you have completely emptied your lungs and you will be able to breath in an even deeper breath This helps keep lungs expanded as well as increase your oxygen level 7 Remember that every medication you take is merely relieving the symptoms not making you well 8 If your still dying go to ER,31,2020-03-29 02:47:57

70,UltraRunningKid,How the fuck did people get on a cruise ship March 7th Are boomers trying to die They are on CNN complaining about how this is unfair to them They got on A FUCKING MONTH after the Diamond Princess was quarantined When they got on the Diamond princess had over 500 cases,23,2020-03-30 18:42:46
71,Bill3ffinMurray,The assumption was made that the US is on or perhaps on a worse track than Italy and that it lagged 2 weeks A little under two weeks ago Italy had it s worst day in terms of confirmed cases 6 557 Since then the daily number of cases has fallen with 4 050 confirmed cases reported on 3 30 The number of newly confirmed cases in the US will be a tough pill to swallow if you re keeping track at home because it will be tremendously high this week But IF the US is like Italy we should start to see numbers slowly recede in the days ahead Number of deaths are going to lag the virus isn t an instant killer So as the number of cases hopefully recedes in the US the number of deaths will remain steady and probably increase Extending the social distancing guidelines until April 30 was the right thing to do We ll have better quality of research and data and news that is hopefully brighter and more favorable Color me cautiously optimistic that for most places a little sense of normalcy will start returning late May early June Until then stay inside wash your hands be kind to your neighbor only take what you need so that others can be secure and for get physicians nurses surgeons registered respiratory therapists anyone who works in our hospitals more help than they need,21,2020-03-31 03:57:50

79,DragunnReEx,Honestly at this point putting any form of faith into U S President Donald J Trump is like putting faith into a shattered record to work He has to be one of the most IDIOTIC presidents I ve ever seen and I ve only been alive for what 17 going on 18 years He continuously just disregards and disrespects all form of medical workers and their struggles and cries Who are you especially as a FUCKING PRESIDENT OF ALL PEOPLE to tell your citizens that medical experts recommendations are just recommendations and that it s voluntary THE FUCK ARE YOU JOKING on what planet does your brain live on for you to say and I quote You can wear one it s voluntary but you don t have to wear one personally I m not and honestly think to your self that s what I the President will tell my citizens His presidency will go down as one of the most idiotic presidential runs ever to occur and I personally hoped he gets ridiculed for his incompetence and complete disregard of medical attention and lack of seriousness in this world crisis every single governor who is in bed with the trump administration should be ashamed of themselves too Especially the Georgia governor who had the AUDACITY to say to his state and the country that he found out about I can t remember completely COVID 19 s asymptomatic spreading and that he learned about it 24 hours after a funeral in Albany Georgia had been compromised and that sadly god bless their souls 95 of everyone there died of it within the week of the funeral Our government is on the brink of pure incompetence and it saddens me right now to think that these are the people elected by us the citizens to lead us That this is the attitude they show to us and how they act in times like these this only strengthens my resolve to reiterate the need to listen to medical experts and healthcare officials and follow there recommendations as thoroughly as possible Please think about would you rather put your well being and safety in the hands of Donald Trump or a Healthcare Official Medical Expert Stay safe Stay inside all We will be fine together AloneTogether,15,2020-04-04 11:30:42
