0,Ugadead1991,I have been lurking in this sub for a while This is the first time I have seen a mega thread for anything,346,2020-01-30 00:11:46
1,Septpap,On a propaganda side note I flew with an international Chinese airline yesterday and upon arrival the warning announcements are very careful to not mention the words China and Coronavirus obviously not wanting to link it to the CCP They said certain countries have been experiencing an outbreak in infectious diseases lately etc etc and then actually listed 7 or 8 countries as danger zones Philippines Africa not a country but they said it some places in the Middle East but not a single mention of China and that you should fill in a form at some or other counter if you re coming from these countries and turn yourself in if you have flu symptoms Not a single sentence that links any of it to China This is still their attitude,235,2020-01-30 09:47:08
2,toxic_badgers,I m a virologist I am actually pretty tired of going through this with people over and over so I appreciate the mega thread dispelling some of the rumors running around Pubmed is an amazing resource for epidemiology on this and will track things better than what you see in press releases since most press releases get their info from pubmed Wuhan coronavirus AKA 2019 nCoV is a coronavirus as many have guessed it is frustrating for the news to just call it coronavirus though as there are hundreds of strains out there ranging from the common cold in people to SARS and MERS while Coronaviruses in people tend to be transmitted via respiratory routs they also are known to pass through the gastrointestinal system in people and animals especially cattle It just depends on the strain Being airborne is scary but as the post says many other diseases are as well masks only masks rated for small particle protection aka viral protection will actually do anything Many surgical masks don t do this N95 type masks will however work That said all masks have an effective use time and their lives can be quite short Surgical masks are only protective for 30 min before they are over saturated with the moisture from your breath and again many do not protect against viruses I believe n95s are good for an hour before they need to be changed But better than wearing a mask cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough to protect others by putting your nose in to your shoulder and wash your hands often hand sanitizer works but washing hands with warm water and soap is better Don t be gross Some patients particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions develop a severe form of pneumonia SARS and MERS both did something similar though MERS was shutting down other organs in people with preexisting conditions like diabetes There s no vaccine yet This is my field though I don t work on corona viruses I make vaccines for Influenza and a few other diseases for a living No vaccine will be commercially viable for some time anyone who says or hopes for soon as in weeks or months is being dishonest with the time frame to make something commercially viable China also has a pretty spotty record with making vaccines at least in agricultural vaccines Edit I am not your travel agent if you are worried about safety traveling to Asia check the state department travel advisories and consult a doctor,161,2020-01-30 01:10:43
3,hairy_butt_creek,Been watching this for a while There s no need to panic by any means but I do think it s something worth keeping an eye on I always keep about three days worth of food on hand just because severe weather flooding can hit and make going to the grocery store a bit tough but I recently upped it to 7 to 10 days Chances are high extremely high that this will all blow over and then the local food bank gets some extra food from me As far as I know there have been no deaths outside of China What concerns me though is the following China has taken extreme steps before any real knowledge of the virus Hell even based on today s numbers shutting down most of a country and quarantining millions of people is a bit extreme I ask myself why Imagine the US quarantining three major cities instituting a lot of travel bans and instituting bans on social events because 100 people got sick The economic cost is already tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars A few more weeks of this could drag the global economy into a recession These are not decisions to be made lightly even by an authoritarian government like China The Chinese government is full of shit It s hard to trust anything coming out of there They do not value their citizens and their only goal is to remain in power It could be much worse than the actual numbers they re reporting but fact of the matter is we don t know It seems to have a high incubation period double that of flu Jury is still out just how easily a person can spread the virus without showing symptoms of the illness Typically with the flu about a day after you get the virus you re already getting sick so you quarantine yourself by crawling into bed but on average this one looks to be six days perhaps up to 14 days That s concerning because that person will have the virus and perhaps be spreading it not realizing they re even sick That s 5 more days of going to work and going to school or hopping on an airplane than the flu virus As more data comes in we ll know more in the next week or so exactly how long it takes to show symptoms and how easily the virus spreads before symptoms appear The fatality isn t that high yet but China is reporting a lot of people in critical care Getting over the flu is rest and plenty of fluids for most but imagine how much more fatal the flu would be if one year a large percentage of people who get the flu require extensive medical care As more people get sick resources become more limited and a person who d otherwise survive with IVs and oxygen doesn t It s almost better to be one of the early infected in that case so you have access to the resources before they become strained It s OK to find a middle ground between the doomsayers who are panicking and people who are convinced this is nothing because past diseases like SARS was nothing I m concerned but I m still living my normal life of work gym happy hour etc Buying some extra canned goods and keeping an eye on the latest is basically the only step I ve taken so far,62,2020-01-30 00:50:52
4,hairy_butt_creek,That WHO press conference was a shit show It was basically China is awesome China is great China is probably the best um we re declaring a global medical emergency but it s NOT because of what China did it s because we re worried about other countries I met with Xi he s amazing feel free to travel to China and countries that block travel to and from China are wrong for doing so go China and hail Xi They took two questions from the media and the first question went straight to China s state media s journalist Nothing of any substance at all Somehow for some reason the WHO really really really is being careful about making China happy Disease doesn t know boundaries or politics so to see that amount of politics from what is supposed to be an apolitical agency is pretty gross,53,2020-01-30 20:20:36

7,Medicus2,It s not the fatality rate that is scary about this virus it s the R0 r nought and the urban location that could be devastating R0 is the average number of other people that an infected person infects Let s say R0 is 3 then for every person who is infected they will infect 3 other people and so on The R0 for this coronavirus could be anywhere from 2 to 5 right now The previous coronavirus outbreaks SARS and MERS had high R0 but relied on super spreaders meaning most infected people may have infected only one other person but there were individuals who for whatever reason were much more contagious and caused hundreds of others that they came into contact with to become infected If a disease relies on super spreaders it is actually a good sign that it will more than likely fizzle out over time since super spreaders tend to be rare and are isolated quickly If this coronavirus doesn t rely on super spreaders and instead truly does have an R0 of 2 to 5 then there will be hundreds of thousands if not millions infected over the next few months Let s say the fatality rate stays around 2 that ll still end up causing potentially hundreds of thousands of deaths Only time will tell I wouldn t panic about it since we are already surrounded by viruses that kill us by the tens of thousands every year But I wouldn t ignore it just to remain blissfully ignorant,40,2020-01-31 04:03:39
8,hmsthinkingmeat,Here s something for you all to think about regarding the official numbers of confirmed cases 1 These are normal hospitals in normal cities it s unlikely they have the resources equipment staff supplies or time to actually test everyone like the 12 000 suspected cases If they are testing them all then the time it will take to get results back will increase which means the official figures are not real time 2 Much worse than that you don t get the virus today get tested and then confirmed today There s a 2 week incubation period where peopel feel no symptoms They then start to feel ill and after say 2 to 3 days go to hospital They are then tested and the results take 2 to 3 days to come back That means from infection to being confirmed as infected is 3 weeks So the official numbers are a snapshot of what was happening 3 weeks ago or maybe even 4 weeks ago If you take the growth in confirmed cases c 45 per day and extrapolate out from 8000 cases to 3 weeks later the number you get is 15 million At 4 weeks it s 200 million The Chinese don t like to admit to problems but they shut down cities quarantining 60 million people halted all public transport cancelled the culturally important new years celebrations the president went on tv to talk about a grave situation and they started building new hospitals and converting others and empty buildings into virus centers They did this when they were claiming 400ish infected and 19 dead What makes more sense they did this at 400 19 or they did this when they already knew the infected and dead were in the tens of thousands and thousands respectively already It s much worse than the official figures common sense and simple logic tell you that the maths simply confirms it,42,2020-01-30 11:49:45
9,ManiacFoSho,The flu has a fatality rate of less than 02 and an R0 of 1 3 The 2019 nCoV has an estimated fatality rate of around 3 and an R0 of 3 edit to clarify R0 or R nought is the number of other people that a typical case will infect In comparison the Black Death that struck during the Middle Ages was estimated to have an R0 of around 1 48 1 91 There s a reason why the World Health Organization calls it extremely worrisome It has already killed more people than SARS and did it in 1 3 of the time One research paper showed that 29 of the patients developed acute respiratory distress and 13 required intensive care In comparison roughly 1 of common flu cases require hospitalization The common flu virus shows symptoms quickly allowing people to limit the spread Someone can have 2019 nCoV and spread it for up to two weeks before they show symptoms Despite China s dramatic measures to contain it the infection rate continues to rise exponentially Source It has infected at least 20 countries and has already spread from person to person in a number of countries TL DR The current risk to the general population is low The potential risk is high,34,2020-01-31 23:14:04

17,ovationman,What people must understand is that the healthcare system worldwide has no extra capacity A new virus that will cause major illness and deaths in many will have a huge impact At least in the US a bad flu season can push an emergency department to the brink we don t need this,24,2020-01-30 00:26:36
18,jfx92,I m in York the only place in the UK where the virus has been 100 confirmed The hotel where it was confirmed is still open No one is doing anything different Can t tell whether we re all just playing the ignorance is bliss card or whether the media is really hyping this up Because the media is making out all of York is shaking with fear and honestly it s barely even getting spoken about I suppose maybe we expected it with such a large population of Chinese tourists in the city centre Not gonna lie I am worried as I have an 11 month old Looks like we re going to be sticking round the house for a bit,24,2020-01-31 22:21:53
19,cnfzs,West European here I wanted to share a small anecdote Two years ago I got sick I started to feel symptoms of a common cold These symptoms started to increase in intensity at night I had severe pain in my extremities and could not sleep I decided to see the doctor the next morning I felt absolutely devestated and someone had to drive me there The doctor took a blood sample and told me to wait In the evening the doctor reached out to me personally in front of my door and told me that I HAVE to go to the hospital At this point I felt like dying In the hospital they did some tests as well I was transfered to the intensive care unit and got infusions I passed out several times It got better from day to day but I remained hospitalized for almost 2 weeks The sickness or the meds has also severly damaged my liver I thus had to follow a strict diet the following months When I asked the doctors what I had they admitted that they do not know They were sure that it was some virus according to samples taken from my spinal cord However they did not know WHAT virus They registered my case in their database Long story short Our modern medical practitioners are so good that they are even able to deal with viruses they do not know I am aware that this is anecdotal evidence Nevertheless it gives me faith in our ability to overcome this epidemic,26,2020-02-02 12:32:54

30,tyresdaeg19,People shouldn t compare it to the flu They are two completely separate viruses Additionally we don t have enough data to determine the r0 too early or a mortality rate since most people haven t cleared the disease yet and the real numbers are too low to be significant The data simply isn t there yet because the epidemic is in its early stages I don t think people should be alarmed outside of Asia but still need to be weary of changes also Plague Inc is fun but not valid for any real comparison,16,2020-01-30 01:45:16

37,JWAxeMan,The fact that few international patients are seriously ill and none have died who were confirmed to have the virus at any rate gives a strangely positive perspective on the overall picture On the one hand the deaths in China are concerning On the other hand the fact that most international patients have mild symptoms leads me to believe that perhaps the virus is far far more widespread in China particularly Wuhan than the current numbers support That would explain why there are so many Chinese deaths relative to the confirmed cases there compared to the international community The Germans are a great example all four who contracted the virus at that company have the mildest symptoms like a cold,15,2020-01-31 15:33:13

67,sue_me_please,Dead man lies on an empty street at China s virus ground zero A grey haired man wearing a face mask lies dead on the pavement at ground zero of China s virus epidemic a plastic shopping bag in one hand On what would typically be a crowded street in Wuhan an industrial city of 11 million under quarantine there are only a few passersby and they dare not go near him AFP journalists saw the body on Thursday morning not long before an emergency vehicle arrived carrying police and medical staff in full body protective suits The man lay straight on his back in front of a closed furniture store Medical staff in blue overalls gently shrouded his body with a blue blanket The ambulance left and police stacked supermarket cardboard boxes to hide the scene AFP could not determine how the man who appeared to be aged in his 60s had died AFP contacted police and local health officials afterwards but could not get details on his case But the reaction of the police and medical staff in hazmat suits as well as some of the bystanders highlighted the fear pervading the city A woman standing near the man wearing pink pyjamas and a Mao cap said she believed he had died from the virus It s terrible she said These days many people have died Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak of the new coronavirus which is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market into humans The virus which emerged late last year has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone With the virus spreading to other countries the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency The dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital one of the main medical centres for treating those with virus symptoms A team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits One man smoking near the scene was told sharply by police to put out his cigarette and don a face mask He quickly followed their orders In the two hours that AFP observed the scene at least 15 ambulances passed by attending other calls Finally a white van with blacked out windows arrived to take away the man The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag and carried into the van on a stretcher Staff immediately began to clean the ground as the van drove away disinfecting the streets where the body had lain,11,2020-01-31 22:24:00

88,TheBigDogAteMyAss,The first of the German cases occurred in an otherwise healthy 33 year old businessman who became ill with a sore throat chills and muscle ache on Jan 24 He had a fever and a cough the next day but by the evening of the following day he started feeling better and went back to work on Jan 27 the same day his China based colleague told company officials that she was ill Outside of China there have now been 45 confirmed cases in 13 countries with no deaths so far the WHO s spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a briefing in Geneva on Tuesday I really do not believe that this virus will be a huge issue in other countries It s a bad disease but I m not sure it s going to hit US the same way as it did in China,10,2020-02-01 22:13:12
89,jfx92,Just out of interest how does this compare to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic I was 17 then and don t remember anything about it which is odd Is it as bad Worse Just been reading about it and wow there were a lot of deaths but it was reassuring that a vaccine was created hopefully the same can happen here,10,2020-02-01 23:11:59

96,ragingbuffalo,Can anyone explain to me why the Coronavirus such a serious threat It appears to infect at the same rate as the regular flu with a similar death rate Is it just because we don t fully know the rates are actually around those numbers,10,2020-01-30 19:57:46
97,darkestb4thadawn,WHO finally comes out and declares a global medical emergency Would love to hear from all the pseudo virologists about how there was nothing to see here,9,2020-01-30 20:13:00
98,TheTwoOneFive,Food for thought on the mortality rate and yes I know this is full of assumptions that would skew it either way such as people who have the virus but haven t died yet additional others asymptomatic who haven t been tested etc As of now there are 0 deaths and 142 infected outside of mainland China If there is a 2 mortality rate as has been suggested the odds of having no deaths at all in 142 cases is 1 in 18 using binomial probability Even halving it to a 1 mortality rate only has a 1 in 4 chance of resulting in no deaths Outside of Hubei province there are 42 of the cases and only 5 of the deaths My guess is that this can be explained by a combination of 2 things 1 Wuhan is under reporting those with no low symptoms due to everyone flooding their clinics and shortage of testing supplies which inflates the mortality rate 2 When medical services are not overwhelmed the odds of dying are much lower than we have seen As a comparison if looking at the highest fatality rate where the odds of all 142 non Chinese patients staying alive is 50 50 it s about 0 49 The calculation for determining how likely something should happen just due to chance alone Ex when you flip a coin twice there is a 50 probability you get a heads and a tails a 25 probability you get 2 heads and a 25 probability you get 2 tails,8,2020-01-31 20:27:05
