24,ThouHastLostAn8th,In total fewer than 500 people have been tested across the country although the CDC has stopped reporting that number in its summary of the outbreak As a result the current official case count inside the United States stood at 43 as of this morning excluding cruise ship cases This number is wrong yet it s still constantly printed and quoted In other contexts we d call this what it is a subtle form of misinformation This artificially low number means that for the past few weeks we ve seen massive state action abroad and only simmering unease domestically While Chinese officials were enacting a world historic containment effort putting more than 700 million people under some kind of movement restriction quarantining tens of millions of people and placing others under new kinds of surveillance and American public health officials were staring at the writing on the wall that the disease was extremely likely to spread in the U S the public health response was stuck in neutral The case count in the U S was not increasing at all Preparing for a sizable outbreak seemed absurd when there were fewer than 20 cases on American soil Now we know that the disease was already spreading and that it was the U S response that was stalled Meanwhile South Korean officials have been testing more than 10 000 people a day driving up the country s reported case count Same goes for Italy high test rate high number of cases,49,2020-03-03 23:54:23

32,overduebook,The Atlantic Only 1 895 Americans have been tested for the coronavirus Our government s response is insane We clearly have many more cases of COVID 19 across the country going untested and therefore undiagnosed even when the patients are in intensive care Everyone is reassuring themselves with the lower numbers coming out of China even while the US does NOTHING whatsoever to prevent spread the way China did We just magically think it will be the same results for no effort apparently Considering the rate at which patients are going undiagnosed and the rate at which community spread is obviously penetrating the country it s much more likely that we end up with an outbreak like Iran unprepared overwhelmed pushed to the brink I think it is misleading to keep Trump s quote at the top of this thread it is obviously untrue and does a grave disservice to those readers trying to understand the scope of the situation The wording of this post indicates that we should listen to Trump s statement first and supplement with CDC and WHO That s nonsense We should disregard Trump s statement entirely and focus only on what medical professionals are saying,43,2020-03-06 17:37:00

97,AwaitingBabyO,The lack of concern in my local Mom group on Facebook is alarming Someone posted a thread that said they d be happy for their family to get coronavirus to build immunity and get it over with Hundreds of comments saying that it s just a cold or just the flu and that the flu is more deadly etc So much misinformation I m not panicking and I am going about life as normal We haven t stocked up on extra groceries or toiletries yet but I m well informed enough to know that this isn t just a cold or flu This could possibly kill most people s grandparents aunts uncles or parents So many people have underlying health conditions I m only 29 years old and relatively healthy except I have severe asthma and a heart defect I m also currently pregnant I don t want to get this virus I don t want to give my family this virus If this is the attitude that a large percentage of our population has it s no wonder the virus spreads the way it does,26,2020-03-08 15:22:02
