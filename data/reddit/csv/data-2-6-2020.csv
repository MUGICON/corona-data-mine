0,Ascensorem,Chinese doctor Li Wenliang one of the eight whistleblowers who tried to warn other medics of the coronavirus outbreak but were reprimanded by local police dies of coronavirus on Thursday in Wuhan,295,2020-02-06 15:55:39
1,magenk,China just called for mass quarantine camps for thousands of patients in Wuhan They are rounding people up with door to door screenings I don t think this situation is improving,162,2020-02-06 11:26:38
2,Bwitm1,How do we feel we humans are doing on this one Dare I be the optimist but I feel like all the countries who aren t China are super freaked out right now into trying to contain it appropriately 8 5 10 on the whole 1 5 for China not ringing the bell earlier,68,2020-02-06 06:37:07
3,Laogama,In Wuhan or rather Hubei the ratio of recoveries to deaths is about 1 1 but in other places it s far higher For example Zhejiang reports 81 recoveries and no deaths Any idea why,63,2020-02-06 07:39:52

7,T1_Thotseize,ITT Scared people fearmongering so that they don t feel like they re freaking out unjustly People are recovering faster than people are dying The death rate is 2 and probably lower due to unreported mild cases Yeah this might be a pandemic but we ve had several of those over the last few decades and there wasn t anarchy in the streets Additionally there are already effective treatments for the virus being tested in Thailand and Hong Kong Stop fear mongering Buy a fortnights worth of canned goods just in case wash your hands and chill out It s fine Especially if you re in the US,32,2020-02-06 18:14:05
8,aquarain,I feel like China started slower to respond than they needed to With experience on SARS and Swine Flu they should have redundant systems in place to recognize a serious emergent pathogen quickly and ring the alarm Obviously what they had in place failed They are now taking hard steps The kind that only a rigid authoritarian state can take They are inconvenient and costly But less costly than not taking them I am hopeful they will get control outside of Hubei Not confident hopeful Inside Hubei that s going to be a complex problem for a long time,33,2020-02-06 06:57:17
9,hairy_butt_creek,Looks like this infection is on at least two cruise ships One is docked off Japan and the other is docked off New Jersey Bugs spread like wildfire on ships the last place I would want to be right now is on a cruise I feel for those stuck in quarantine on the cruise ship docked off Japan For anyone who has been on a cruise most cabin rooms are extremely tiny with no natural light at all Maybe what 250sq ft or so Sure people bring food and supplies to you but you can t really leave your cabin even for a little bit because if you re sick you ll spread the virus but if you re healthy you may catch it People with suites have it a bit better at least but still after a few days even that is unimaginable The cruise I was on had a shitty TV that picked up like ten channels so that s about all they have for entertainment What a fucking nightmare for those people One of my coworkers is thinking of cancelling her cruise and I think it s a great idea for her to do One single passenger or crew member could really fuck everything up,30,2020-02-07 15:53:08

14,the_guy_in_singapore,Singapore has increased risk posture to DORSCON Orange following three new cases that have no connection to China Seems like it is getting harder and harder to contain this in such a densely populated city Additional measure being implemented to reduce public gatherings and to prepare companies to activate business continuity plans There is definitely an increased sense of panic here now I ve been getting lots of messages all evening from friends getting more concerned and people are stocking up on non perishables,23,2020-02-07 12:33:33

25,TheTwoOneFive,Took the JHU charts of growing cases to make charts showing how it is changing as a percentage The growth rate appears to be steadily slowing First chart is the increase of cases on a given day compared to the day before e g 100 cases yesterday 150 today would be a 50 increase second one is a 3 day rolling average e g 100 cases on Feb 1 200 cases on Feb 4 to show a 100 increase on Feb 4 to help smooth out peaks valleys and show more of a trendline I want to do a similar thing but net active cases i e those currently infected removing recovered dead but the JHU datasets that have that information appear to be different than the graph that they use The graph appears to be total cases at the end of the day and the datasets vary by time of day each day Open to thoughts on how to chart that,9,2020-02-06 10:59:22
26,marieennui,Is there any data on the demographic of those the virus has killed I keep hearing that this is only dangerous to those who are old or have other respiratory diseases I was wondering if the data supports this,11,2020-02-08 07:33:46

34,DraydenDawn,Here is a link to the comprehensive study of clinical characteristics that were experienced in the 138 infected in one hospital in Wuhan China just published on 7FEB20 EDIT Just to make it clear The mortality rate of 4 3 is not representative of the whole population since this study was conducted on a select group of patients in just one hospital,7,2020-02-08 13:19:28
35,va_wanderer,The good news remains that epidemic levels of 2019 Novel C remain only inside China The bad news is of course that it s a 2019 Novel C epidemic inside China s quarantined areas and China has never been the most open about disease numbers in order to keep a firm thumb on the population Horrible as that may seem it s better than having panicked infected populations fleeing and increasing the infection rates elsewhere and may actually burn out the main source of the outbreaks in a month or two simply because the virus runs out of fresh hosts to infect and pass along The news up in the air is how big a hit this will be on China itself notably it s economy Transit is naturally badly interrupted businesses are shut down and industrial production is going to end up slashed That and the ripple effect on the world economy is going to be the real impact if China manages to keep the virus from widespread infections outside of it s borders Of course if it doesn t all bets are off,7,2020-02-09 00:30:24

37,KhazintheDark,So an image just dropped from somebody who might actually be in Wuhan The image alleges that the virus is worse than is being reported by the Chinese government The post was made to 4chan so y know take it with a grain of salt but Let s face it it wouldn t be out of character for their government to supress the information or lie about the number of cases Link to reverse image search of the image It s apparently been posted in r singapore but that user deleted the post their account Edit It s possible that the army is shuffling patients around to muddy the numbers like they did with SARS Regarding the mortality rate its possible that the hospital they re in is being used as a corpse consolidation centre for quarantine Edit2 Estimated to be just under 14k bodies being cremated if SO2 readings are accurate Maths is in the picture,8,2020-02-09 16:47:18

64,Aschverizen,What do you guys think will change in China after everything is over As the World outside China we can see how much influence the CCP has over their nation and honestly I can t blame why those who are established enough to emigrate somewhere else and the reason why China takes Over the World is a pipe dream the current state of their culture and politics can never be fully accepted globally compared to how America was the leader in current Global Culture they re control over their People is terrifying and is one of the reasons that if they ever try to expand it will be met with resistance I hope that something meaningful will change for the people in China even if they can t oust the regime they can at least change how the people in power think and act for the interest of the people rather just themselves,2,2020-02-08 23:23:05
65,heyheoy,For those thinking that China is doing it wrong they did wrong was not going fast at start and let the virus propagate by paralyzing the country economy etc The death ratio isnt that high but the recovery is taking 20 30 days where people need to stay in hospital beds Now in this time of the year when the coronavirus exploded Chinese make 2 5 billion trip during their new year holiday i think people cant understand the magnitud of that holiday week Imagine if the 20 of the population gets infected thats near 300 million Chinese people in hospital beds And not counting the other millions with another medical conditions they wont have the medical capacity masks medicines doctors etc And about the cases reported if they dont have the amount of test kits i remember someone say they have near 3k test kits ok they cant report today we have 6000 new infected if they cant confirm that since it will be lying also Thats why theres a Suspected cases label,1,2020-02-09 00:47:00

67,va_wanderer,Honestly I expect fewer cases to show outside the Chinese borders as other nations and China have both been effective at throttling travel I do also expect Chinese cases to continue though There s far too many areas where exposure is inevitable and would result in another outbreak cluster and quarantine only seems to have been slowing the rate of new infections rather than choking it off completely,2,2020-02-09 23:45:33
