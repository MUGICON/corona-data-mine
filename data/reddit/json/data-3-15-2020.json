reinfection this LA times article makes a few good points Many reinfections may not be reinfections at all It may be the result of initial false positives due to cross contamination false negatives after supposed recovery where the virus lay dormant or was not well detected and false positives for subsequent testing due again to cross contamination and other factors The only way to know if reinfection truly happened would be to sequence the genome of the virus in the initial positive and the subsequent positive If the virus mutated quickly enough this constitutes a reinfection Another factor is that some people s immune systems may not be functioning properly and the virus resurged in the body Many patients in Wuhan may have been discharged prematurely to make space in beds for new

night to O Hare in chicago from london We didnt get through Customs and CDC until 12 30 am First they put everyone from Europe in a separate customs line which took over 2 hours to get through Then they sent us all to another separate line to once again give passports to a boarder patrol agent so he can type in your phone number and email address for who knows what reason This took another two hours Then they funnel you into a third line to speak with CDC people answer questions and get temperature checks At one point in the second line they halted our line for 45 minutes no one moved Shortly after for some reason they started putting people that were way behind us in the customs lines in a different CDC waiting line and then all of them started to go through before us who waited hours longer People were ready to riot yelling at boarder patrol asking why we weren t moving and other lines were Boarder patrol gave no answers to anyone and just kept saying that person is just doing what they re told their job and we dont have any better answers than you It was pure insanity Not to mention theyve got hundreds of people from Europe standing in queues for hours definitely represents a larger health risk than just letting people through more efficiently They also told us it was going to get worse as UK and Ireland will be joining the ban today So what I m saying is be prepared to spend 4 or more hours in line after you get off the planes Make arrangements with traveling home to hold off until you get through CDC checks If you get rerouted through one of the 13 airports doing this and have a connection flight elsewhere you will almost certainly miss it unless it s 5 hour layover There were many in our line that their connecting flights left before we made it through the first customs line The only good thing they did was walk up and down the lines offering water and small snacks But if you travel from Europe you may want to buy some extra food before leaving for the US because you wont be able to leave to get anything especially those with kids This is just a heads up from my experience last night and hope to just prepare everyone for what s to
