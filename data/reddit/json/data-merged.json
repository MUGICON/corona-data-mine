countries as danger zones Philippines Africa not a country but they said it some places in the Middle East but not a single mention of China and that you should fill in a form at some or other counter

some of the rumors running around Pubmed is an amazing resource for epidemiology on this and will track things better than what you see in press releases since most press releases get their info from pubmed Wuhan coronavirus AKA 2019 nCoV is a coronavirus as many have guessed it is frustrating for the news to just call it coronavirus though as there are hundreds of strains out there ranging from the common cold in people to SARS and MERS while Coronaviruses in people tend to be transmitted via respiratory routs they also are known to pass through the gastrointestinal system in people and animals especially cattle It just depends on the strain Being airborne is scary but as the post says many other diseases are as well masks only masks rated for small particle protection aka viral protection will actually do anything Many surgical masks don t do this N95 type masks will however work That said all masks have an effective use time and their lives can be quite short Surgical masks are only protective for 30 min before they are over saturated with the moisture from your breath and again many do not protect against viruses I believe n95s are good for an hour before they need to be changed But better than wearing a mask cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough to protect others by putting your nose in to your shoulder and wash your hands often hand sanitizer works but washing hands with warm water and soap is better Don t be gross Some patients particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions develop a severe form of pneumonia SARS and MERS both did something similar though MERS was shutting down other organs in people with preexisting conditions like diabetes There s no vaccine yet This is my field though I don t work on corona viruses I make vaccines for Influenza and a few other diseases for a living No vaccine will be commercially viable for some time anyone who says or hopes for soon as in weeks or months is being dishonest with the time frame to make something commercially viable China also has a pretty spotty record with making vaccines at least in agricultural vaccines Edit I am not your travel agent if you are worried

watching this for a while There s no need to panic by any means but I do think it s something worth keeping an eye on I always keep about three days worth of food on hand just because severe weather flooding can hit and make going to the grocery store a bit tough but I recently upped it to 7 to 10 days Chances are high extremely high that this will all blow over and then the local food bank gets some extra food from me As far as I know there have been no deaths outside of China What concerns me though is the following China has taken extreme steps before any real knowledge of the virus Hell even based on today s numbers shutting down most of a country and quarantining millions of people is a bit extreme I ask myself why Imagine the US quarantining three major cities instituting a lot of travel bans and instituting bans on social events because 100 people got sick The economic cost is already tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars A few more weeks of this could drag the global economy into a recession These are not decisions to be made lightly even by an authoritarian government like China The Chinese government is full of shit It s hard to trust anything coming out of there They do not value their citizens and their only goal is to remain in power It could be much worse than the actual numbers they re reporting but fact of the matter is we don t know It seems to have a high incubation period double that of flu Jury is still out just how easily a person can spread the virus without showing symptoms of the illness Typically with the flu about a day after you get the virus you re already getting sick so you quarantine yourself by crawling into bed but on average this one looks to be six days perhaps up to 14 days That s concerning because that person will have the virus and perhaps be spreading it not realizing they re even sick That s 5 more days of going to work and going to school or hopping on an airplane than the flu virus As more data comes in we ll know more in the next week or so exactly how long it takes to show symptoms and how easily the virus spreads before symptoms appear The fatality isn t that high yet but China is reporting a lot of people in critical care Getting over the flu is rest and plenty of fluids for most but imagine how much more fatal the flu would be if one year a large percentage of people who get the flu require extensive medical care As more people get sick resources become more limited and a person who d otherwise survive with IVs and oxygen doesn t It s almost better to be one of the early infected in that case so you have access to the resources before they become strained It s OK to find a middle ground between the doomsayers who are panicking and people who are convinced this is nothing because past diseases like SARS was nothing I m concerned but I m still living my normal life of work gym happy hour etc Buying some extra canned goods and keeping an eye on the latest is basically the only step I

this virus it s the R0 r nought and the urban location that could be devastating R0 is the average number of other people that an infected person infects Let s say R0 is 3 then for every person who is infected they will infect 3 other people and so on The R0 for this coronavirus could be anywhere from 2 to 5 right now The previous coronavirus outbreaks SARS and MERS had high R0 but relied on super spreaders meaning most infected people may have infected only one other person but there were individuals who for whatever reason were much more contagious and caused hundreds of others that they came into contact with to become infected If a disease relies on super spreaders it is actually a good sign that it will more than likely fizzle out over time since super spreaders tend to be rare and are isolated quickly If this coronavirus doesn t rely on super spreaders and instead truly does have an R0 of 2 to 5 then there will be hundreds of thousands if not millions infected over the next few months Let s say the fatality rate stays around 2 that ll still end up causing potentially hundreds of thousands of deaths Only time will tell I wouldn t panic about it since we are already surrounded

figures are not real time 2 Much worse than that you don t get the virus today get tested and then confirmed today There s a 2 week incubation period where peopel feel no symptoms They then start to feel ill and after say 2 to 3 days go to hospital They are then tested and the results take 2 to 3 days to come back That means from infection to being confirmed as infected is 3 weeks So the official numbers are a snapshot of what was happening 3 weeks ago or maybe even 4 weeks ago If you take the growth in confirmed cases c 45 per day and extrapolate out from 8000 cases to 3 weeks later the

culturally important new years celebrations the president went on tv to talk about a grave situation and they started building new hospitals and converting others and empty buildings into virus centers They did this when they were claiming 400ish infected and 19 dead What makes more sense they did this at 400 19 or they did this when they already knew the infected and dead were in the tens

near him AFP journalists saw the body on Thursday morning not long before an emergency vehicle arrived carrying police and medical staff in full body protective suits The man lay straight on his back in front of a closed furniture store Medical staff in blue overalls gently shrouded his body with a blue blanket The ambulance left and police stacked supermarket cardboard boxes to hide the scene AFP could not determine how the man who appeared to be aged in his 60s had died AFP contacted police and local health officials afterwards but could not get details on his case But the reaction of the police and medical staff in hazmat suits as well as some of the bystanders highlighted the fear pervading the city A woman standing near the man wearing pink pyjamas and a Mao cap said she believed he had died from the virus It s terrible she said These days many people have died Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak of the new coronavirus which is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market into humans The virus which emerged late last year has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone With the virus spreading to other countries the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency The dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital one of the main medical centres for treating those with virus symptoms A team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits One man smoking near the scene was told sharply by police to put out his cigarette and don a face mask He quickly followed their orders In the two hours that AFP observed the scene at least 15 ambulances passed by attending other calls Finally a white van with blacked out windows arrived to take away the man The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag and carried into the van on a

reporting those with no low symptoms due to everyone flooding their clinics and shortage of testing supplies which inflates the mortality rate 2 When medical services are not overwhelmed the odds of dying are much lower than we have seen As a comparison if looking at the highest fatality rate where the odds of all 142 non Chinese patients staying alive is 50 50 it s about 0 49 The calculation for

believes this coronavirus will become a community transmitted infection meaning it will gain a foothold in the community and will become an annual thing The scary part is that it is more contagious

symptoms present It s certainly not the end of the world We should all be more terrified of the flu which is all around us for most of the year But COVID 19 is definitely going to have a significant impact on our medical infrastructure primarily putting increased stress on our ICUs across the country A vaccine will be available in around 1 year and we will need approximately 80 immunization to achieve herd immunity within the community This will certainly not be easy to achieve The biggest takeaway that I got was that we have a small window of opportunity to nip this in the bud and we need to take advantage of it But if this virus does get out of control life will continue on It ll just be yet another respiratory virus that causes fevers and cough that we will have to deal with year

2020 will kill an estimated 41 000 people in the USA alone currently much higher than the less than 3 000 reported deaths worldwide for COVID 19 it is also important to remember that the seasonal flu infects an estimated 41 000 000 people a year in the USA source That means that 1 in every 1 000 people who get the seasonal flu die ie 0 1 of people COVID 19 on the other hand has an estimated fatality rate of 1 in every 100 people and that s a low estimate The COVID 19 virus is highly contagious and is rapidly spreading throughout the globe If COVID 19 became as widespread in the USA as Influenza the numbers of death would be quite different If the same 41 000 000 were infected within the year the estimated death toll would be 410 000 That s a death toll almost the size of Minneapolis The mortality rate combined with the virus high infection rate is why many people are worried about COVID 19 but there is more to it than that We have vaccines to help protect vulnerable

months here are some simple easy to follow things you can do right now to better prepare yourself for whatever x200B 1 Buy a little extra food Freeze dried stuff doesn t taste great but you can put it on a shelf and forget about it for the next 10 20 years Good brands include in no particular order Augason Farms Mountain House Wise Foods Backpackers Pantry MyPatriotSupply don t laugh and Chef s Banquet Also consider a backup way to boil water in case the power gas goes out Extreme budget options spam peanut butter crackers instant pancake mix canned soup canned chicken tuna beans honey 2 Think about water This can be as simple as filling a few jugs with tapwater Figure on one gallon per person per day If you want to get fancy there are lots of high quality filtration systems out there Sawyer Katadyn Lifestraw and Berkey are all good brands depending on your budget As much as I enjoy coffee from my local roasters I always keep a sealed jar of instant coffee on hand just in case Instant nothing 3 Remember your pets Always keep an extra unopened bag of food on hand Same with cans If you have cats do the same with litter 4 You ll want something to do Books are always the answer I like cheesy scifi anthologies but YMMV Movies and whatnot are great but think about a severe storm where the power internet cellular service might go out 5 Medicine If you have any prescriptions switch to a 90 day refill if you can DO NOT short your dosage to stretch it out Stock up on whatever you need to ride out a cold or flu aspirin ibuprofen acetaminophen day night flu medicine etc Ditto for any medicines your pet may need Remember by US law generics are always exactly the same active ingredient s as name brand Contrary to popular hysteria it s profoundly unlikely that this will result in the total collapse of all society as we know it HOWEVER it s good to think about what you d do in a real emergency Consider what would happen if your area lost power for 72 hours heat even gas furnaces would fail pipes would burst sewer systems would back up cell service would go down not all cell sites have generators water would go out cats and dogs living together mass hysteria What would you do There s no right answer for everyone it all depends on your budget needs and situation Thinking about it today is a lot better than trying to figure it all out in a real emergency A warning about 1 many freeze dried food vendors advertise based on how many meals a package contains Ignore this number it s just marketing fluff That meal might be only 200 calories with zero protein Instead look at the total number of calories you re buying Divide the price including shipping by the number of calories This allows you to directly compare brands Again it is profoundly unlikely that this will make any significant impact on your life But it s never a bad idea to think ahead and be prepared EDIT I m not saying freeze dried food tastes bad it s just not great At no point in your life will you ever go man I really wish I had some freeze dried lasagna instead of this fresh stuff But when the power s out on a cold winter day and you want something hot with minimal effort freeze dried stuff is much more filling than soup", "score": "32", "time": "2020-02-26 15:41:47"}, {"author": "Emozpqqy", "content": "Let more than 1 post on this sub be about coronavirus It s a huge issue

rate This is because confirmed cases over represent individuals with severe reactions to the virus For every person who shows up at the hospital with severe symptoms there is likely to be several or more who don t even realize they are infected A virus with a lower fatality rate is easier to spread and harder to contain for the precise reason that most human carriers are asymptomatic or have unalarming symptoms According to Dr Anthony Faucci director of the NAIID in the US his high level contacts in China have confirmed that asymptomatic transmission between persons is a certainty according to what Chinese health authorities are now observing on the ground The 1918 pandemic flu that killed tens of millions around the world had only a 1 fatality rate but infected nearly 40 of the world The current corona virus probably have an actual fatality rate some where between 0 1 normal flu season and 1 like the 1918 pandemic This makes it an exceptional public health threat The vast majority of the fatalities have been seen in the elderly or immune comprised individuals It does not seem to be a significant threat to healthy adults under age 50 or children As things stand it s still far too early to project whether the virus will be contained As it stands Chinese government efforts are probably slowing down the spread but may not fully contain it Coronaviruses tend to spread better during winter months when the combination of cold temperatures and humidity help preserve the virus During the warmer dryer months of the year viruses tend to spread less well This it s possible that if the spread of the virus is slowed enough the warming weather could help further slow the spread Vaccines are currently under development in the US and else where and maybe ready for wide deployment in about one year This is too slow to affect control efforts now but may be able to help by next winter One resource for those wishing to get understanding of the virus is a series of

basically being given a get out of jail free card on the economic fallout that s happening and he s ripping it up because he s the one who keeps bringing up the economy and how important it is Right now Americans and basically the world just want to get over this bug As the experts are saying this isn t some three day blizzard and life will be back to normal next week This is a long and dark winter that is coming Pretty much all experts with actual training and knowledge are saying right now that life is not going to even begin to return to normal for months This is coming and it s going to wreck a lot of shit America needs a leader that will see us through the storm first and then focus on rebuilding Right now Trump doesn t care about what is going to happen during the storm at all he wants to pretend it away and focus on rebuilding before it even hits Is the economy a consideration right now Sure however all focus needs to be right now on mitigation and treatment FEMA needs to be building hospitals and organizing medical response The US government needs to make sure that there s food supplies and medicine readily available to all parts of the country The money doesn t need to be put into tax cuts or rebuilding right now it needs to be put into making sure people who are effected get necessities taken care of until they re back on their feet We need a leader who values life right now instead we have a moron who cares about money", "score": "52", "time": "2020-03-11 21:42:46"}, {"author": "Mixtape_", "content": "The University of Florida is strongly encouraging

Italy Dr Daniele Macchini Read until the end I found it chilling from a few days ago things are worse now After much thought about whether and what to write about what is happening to us I felt that silence was not responsible I will therefore try to convey to people far from our reality what we are living in Bergamo in these days of Covid 19 pandemic I understand the need not to create panic but when the message of the dangerousness of what is happening does not reach people I shudder I myself watched with some amazement the reorganization of the entire hospital in the past week when our current enemy was still in the shadows the wards slowly emptied elective activities were interrupted intensive care were freed up to create as many beds as possible All this rapid transformation brought an atmosphere of silence and surreal emptiness to the corridors of the hospital that we did not yet understand waiting for a war that was yet to begin and that many including me were not so sure would ever come with such ferocity I still remember my night call a week ago when I was waiting for the results of a swab When I think about it my anxiety over one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified now that I ve seen what s happening Well the situation now is dramatic to say the least The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night But now that need for beds has arrived in all its drama One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace The boards with the names of the patients of different colours depending on the operating unit are now all red and instead of surgery you see the diagnosis which is always the damned same bilateral interstitial pneumonia An epidemiological disaster is taking place And there are no more surgeons urologists orthopedists we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us Cases are multiplying we arrive at a rate of 15 20 admissions per day all for the same reason The results of the swabs now come one after the other positive positive positive Suddenly the E R is collapsing Reasons for the access always the same fever and breathing difficulties fever and cough respiratory failure Radiology reports always the same bilateral interstitial pneumonia bilateral interstitial pneumonia bilateral interstitial pneumonia All to be hospitalized Someone already to be intubated and go to intensive care For others it s too late Every ventilator becomes like gold those in operating theatres that have now suspended their non urgent activity become intensive care places that did not exist before The staff is exhausted I saw the tiredness on faces that didn t know what it was despite the already exhausting workloads they had I saw a solidarity of all of us who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask what can I do for you now Doctors who move beds and transfer patients who administer therapies instead of nurses Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can t save everyone and the vital parameters of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny There are no more shifts no more hours Social life is suspended for us We no longer see our families for fear of infecting them Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols Some of our colleagues who are infected also have infected relatives and some of their relatives are already struggling between life and death So be patient you can t go to the theatre museums or the gym Try to have pity on the myriad of old people you could exterminate We just try to make ourselves useful You should do the same we influence the life and death of a few dozen people You with yours many

reinfection truly happened would be to sequence the genome of the virus in the initial positive and the subsequent positive If the virus mutated quickly enough this constitutes a reinfection Another

night to O Hare in chicago from london We didnt get through Customs and CDC until 12 30 am First they put everyone from Europe in a separate customs line which took over 2 hours to get through Then they sent us all to another separate line to once again give passports to a boarder patrol agent so he can type in your phone number and email address for who knows what reason This took another two hours Then they funnel you into a third line to speak with CDC people answer questions and get temperature checks At one point in the second line they halted our line for 45 minutes no one moved Shortly after for some reason they started putting people that were way behind us in the customs lines in a different CDC waiting line and then all of them started to go through before us who waited hours longer People were ready to riot yelling at boarder patrol asking why we weren t moving and other lines were Boarder patrol gave no answers to anyone and just kept saying that person is just doing what they re told their job and we dont have any better answers than you It was pure insanity Not to mention theyve got hundreds of people from Europe standing in queues for hours definitely represents a larger health risk than just letting people through more efficiently They also told us it was going to get worse as UK and Ireland will be joining the ban today So what I m saying is be prepared to spend 4 or more hours in line after you get off the planes Make arrangements with traveling home to hold off until you get through CDC checks If you get rerouted through one of the 13 airports doing this and have a connection flight elsewhere you will almost certainly miss it unless it s 5 hour layover There were many in our line that their connecting flights left before we made it through the first customs line The only good thing they did was walk up and down the lines offering water and small snacks But if you travel from Europe you may want to buy some extra food before leaving for the US because you wont be able to leave to get anything especially those with kids This is just a heads up from my experience last night and hope to just prepare everyone for what s to

and many cultures I m Asian and split my life in Asian and Western countries my whole life and wanted to put in words my informed opinion of the risk factors of COVID19 going out of control This may give perspective of people who are looking to understand this better or anxious people who want better control of risk managing their life I m no professional expert aside from my qualifications described above I would categorise the macro level risks factors very generally to geographical factors societal factors I m focusing on risk of COVID19 spreading uncontrollably not necessarily mortality risks I also acknowledge individuals in in each country will behave differently Religiosity is a very high risk factor because the population regularly congregates at places of worship regardless of the specific religion It also determines the willingness to believe in viral protection provided by a divine entity Vigilance is driven by whether the population had recent experience with epidemics or disasters recently I m looking at the countries at the start of COVID19 as each country is rapidly adapting once the disease starts spreading and success and failure then becomes materially impacted by the government leadership and controls China Medium Risk Societal factors include low religiosity high vigilance complies with authoritative controls small family units medium STEM knowledge poor hygiene practices Geographical factors include high population density medium internal travel aside from Chinese New Year migration and international internal land routes that can be controlled quickly Italy Spain Greece High Risk Societal factors include high religiosity low vigilance sceptical of authoritative controls many multi generation families living together and medium STEM knowledge Geographical factors include medium population density many overseas visitors and many open international internal land routes France UK Medium to High Risk Societal factors include medium religiosity low vigilance sceptical of authoritative controls medium STEM knowledge Geographical factors include medium population density many overseas visitors and many open international internal land routes Germany Scandinavian Countries Medium Risk Societal factors due to low religiosity low vigilance receptive to authoritative communal controls High STEM knowledge Geographical factors medium to low population density moderate overseas visitors multiple open International internal Borders but Scandinavian countries have less routes into the country the further north they are

specific communities to low California North Eastern States religiosity low vigilance rejects authoritative controls medium STEM knowledge Geographical factors high LA San Francisco New York City to low Alaska Middle America population density and number of overseas visitors Many international and open land routes Hope you find this useful and something to think about Summarising the above and observing what s happening in the real world in my humble opinion high vigilance low overseas visitors and low religiosity seems to be the biggest factor as whether a country gets control of the initial attempts for the Virus to spread Receptiveness to authoritative control religiosity again then determines how quickly the country regains control after the initial spread Again this is my informed opinion feel free to disagree with my observation above You may consider applying these observations to your own individual circumstances community etc Looking at the above it s not really

how long it takes to flatten the curve I think this article by Inan Dogan PHD explains it best This is my interpretation 1 We don t know the true infection rate because we started testing way too late

We do know approximately how long it takes from the time of infection to the time of recovery or death 4 Since we can t know the true infection rate based on current test reports we can look at the number of deaths and work backwards to determine what the infection rate was for the past couple months and also predict what the future will look like Based on the above information we can look at the case fatality rate in the U S so far and determine that there were at least 1 6 million people infected with SARS CoV 2 around mid March in the United States When this thesis was published on March 20th Dogan predicted that there would be around 800 deaths in the United States by the 26th Today is the 26th and we re close to 1 100 deaths He was being conservative in his estimations which is probably why we re at a higher number today We know that the number of deaths are doubling every 3 days If the average time from infection to recovery or death is 24 days then we should expect the number of deaths to continue to climb and then start to peak 24 days after the start of the quarantine Considering schools and businesses began closing around March 14th here in the U S that should put the start of the peak of the curve and the death rate at approximately 30 000 35 000 deaths around April 7 10 This model also shows that it is highly likely that millions of us have already been infected which means we will have established herd immunity much sooner than we thought But you re not allowed to say that because of all the stupid people that will read that and decide that it s ok to go be with Amanda Huginkiss again If you take this information as justification for fewer quarantine restrictions right now I give you an F for reading comprehension At most this means that places

please heed my warning for I am the WHO But Donald just laughed I ve not heard it said Of an invisible virus that s easily spread See here now WHO there s no need to whine I m sure that it will all be it will all be just fine So Donald went golfing no need to prepare For a mysterious virus that s not even there Listen he said I don t mean to boast But here in this country a few cases at most But the WHO kept on warning and at least in the states Some leaders decided Well prudence dictates That we listen to Science and accept with some Grace That we re all going to have to just shelter in place But Donald got angry and said Don t you see You re making it harder to reelect me Ignore the WHO sure the virus is here But soon like a miracle it will just disappear And Hannity said on his show Listen folks This whole virus thing is a liberal hoax Pretending that this thing is worse than the flu Is just liberals trying to persecute you So blue states and red states each went their way And the virus exploited every delay So for Donald and red team it was quite a surprise When the cases and body count started to rise So Donald went out and said on TV There s never been anyone better than me And despite all the insults that liberals lob 200K dead is a really good job Well said the WHO at least now you see That it would have been better to listen to me But Donald said Oh you foolish WHO I knew this was serious LONG before you My uncle taught Science and I have his genes That s why I was first to see what this all means So the WHO went home and wept in his bed For words

therapist to help fight the Corona virus and I am a retired one too old to work in a hospital setting I m gonna share some common sense wisdom with those that have the virus and trying to stay home If my advice is followed as given you will improve your chances of not ending up in the hospital on a ventilator This applies to the otherwise generally healthy population so use discretion 1 Only high temperatures kill a virus so let your fever run high Tylenol Advil Motrin Ibuprofen etc will bring your fever down allowing the virus to live longer They are saying that ibuprophen advil etc will actually exacerbate the virus Use common sense and don t let fever go over 103 or 104 if you got the guts If it gets higher than that take your tylenol not ibuprophen or advil to keep it regulated It helps to keep house warm and cover up with blankets so body does not have to work so hard to generate the heat It usually takes about 3 days of this to break the fever 2 The body is going to dehydrate with the elevated temperature so you must rehydrate yourself regulaly whether you like it or not Gatorade with real sugar or pedialyte with real sugar for kids works well Why the sugar Sugar will give your body back the energy it is using up to create the fever The electrolytes and fluid you are losing will also be replenished by the Gatorade If you don t do this and end up in the hospital they will start an IV and give you D5W sugar water and Normal Saline to replenish electrolytes Gatorade is much cheaper pain free and comes in an assortment of flavors 3 You must keep your lungs moist Best done by taking long steamy showers on a regular basis if your wheezing or congested use a real minty toothpaste and brush your teeth while taking the steamy shower and deep breath through your mouth This will provide some bronchial dialation and help loosen the phlegm Force your self to cough into a wet wash cloth pressed firmly over your mouth and nose which will cause greater pressure in your lungs forcing them to expand more and break loose more of the congestion 4 Eat healthy and regularly Gotta keep your strength up 5 Once the fever breaks start moving around to get the body back in shape and blood circulating 6 Deep breath on a regular basis even when it hurts If you don t it becomes easy to develope pneumonia Pursed lip breathing really helps That s breathing in deep and slow then exhaling through tight lips as if your blowing out a candle blow until you have completely emptied your lungs and you will be able to breath in an even deeper breath This helps keep lungs expanded as well as increase your oxygen level 7 Remember that every medication you take is merely relieving the symptoms not making you well 8 If your still dying go to ER", "score": "31", "time":

announced the new restrictions with an urgency to stop the rapid spread of this virus as there has been significant increase in cases over the last few days All of this was predictable Future exponential growth predictions show that by next Sunday 29th March there will be over 5 500 confirmed cases The lag delay in detecting COVID 19 cases is approximately 7 days due to the incubation

society picking up their kids from school going to work touching surfaces like fuel pumps shopping trolleys etc The 7 day lag of identifying cases also means that any of the isolation measures enacted today will not begin to have an effect until after this coming weekend Therefore I am confident that the official numbers will be over 5 500 by this coming Sunday Then I expect that the Aus Gov will announce even more severe restrictions on social mobility but remember this will also have a 7 day delay on the reported numbers Rinse repeat for next weekend Currently a fortnight from now it is

months You can make it easier on everyone if you sort out your paperwork early and adopt a common sense approach to interacting with public services to lessen the load Try online first If the online system is down have a look at the website to prepare COVID 19 info Policy and legislative drafting re social security and family assistance is not made in Centrelink but in the Dept of Social Services Read all about the details here Coronavirus COVID 19 information and support Useful Info For Claims Newstart claim go through each question and the checklist at the end carefully Get all your paperwork in order and scan or photograph your documents to produce decent quality uploads to make it easier for the staff to process your claim BTW a blurry photo that s mostly dark grey or a photo that s huge or tiny is kind is a shitty thing to upload So please try and read your photos before you upload them If at all possible turning your uploads into PDFs makes things easier on everyone Similarly changing the file names for your uploads to describe contents Surname ID Date will help Some of the information you would normally see below need would include ID including showing residence details eg passport with visa if you have it recent employment information if you are applying because of recent income loss perhaps try and get something from your employer in writing about lack of work etc if this is easy enough to get I would do it for no other reason as it will give you evidence for your future CV If you re still working recent payslips if you re not working employment separation certificates evidence of every source of income such as recent payslips or if self employed your last tax return you might need to do an estimated profit and loss statement if you don t have a tax return statements and bank balances for all of your bank accounts info about any shares you own remember those Telstra amp amp amp amp IAG shares You will need the ASX code and number of shares you hold if you pay rent a rent certificate it recent lease if you have a partner you also have to provide details for them incl ID and all income and asset info NB a lot of verification requirements are going to be waived during the crisis so don t despair if you can t get certain documents Why claims processing can take weeks Skipping information or not providing everything you need wastes so much time It will delay your claim and drive you and the Centrelink staff who will be inundated mad The easier you can make it to approve the claim the quicker it can be processed If you re not uploading something because it s a bit hard to find something it means that someone will have to send a letter or make a call while there s another 100 claims are waiting That takes time and may not happen days after the person decided they could get no further with your claim Then when you provide the information your claim will not be able to be picked up immediately because there s another 100 who also had to bring more stuff So suck it up and get your shit together Time to adult How to help reduce call wait times if at all possible check online info before you call have ID paper and pen ready to take notes Don t start calls with complaints about Centrelink wait times government personal history of shitty things you had to go through to get help If 50 000 people reduce their calls
