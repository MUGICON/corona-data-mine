the country s borders almost entirely closed and wait until this thing burns out In 3 4 months we could go largely back to normal but nobody in or out of the country In this case we d need to maintain strict measures related to imports and would wait to reopen the borders until a vaccine is widely available This is only really an option for a few countries those without land borders essentially and we re one of them Option 2 Flatten the curve We attempt to hold cases at a level the healthcare system can handle We keep social distancing measures some business closures and we work study from home where practical This keeps the economy going in a limited sense but results in 5 10 times as many deaths and makes the crisis go on for 12 months until a vaccine is available I think we should choose

society picking up their kids from school going to work touching surfaces like fuel pumps shopping trolleys etc The 7 day lag of identifying cases also means that any of the isolation measures enacted today will not begin to have an effect until after this coming weekend Therefore I am confident that the official numbers will be over 5 500 by this coming Sunday Then I expect that the Aus Gov will

Centrelink during COVID 19 I cross posted this on R coronavirusdownunder will be updating there For updated post go here Please be aware all the COVID legislation passed on 23 March and a few are still going through and it takes time for that information to be known by officers so don t expect all the answers this week Centrelink services are going to be very very stretched over the coming months You can make it easier on everyone if you sort out your paperwork early and adopt a common sense approach to interacting with public services to lessen the load Try online first If the online system is down have a look at the website to prepare COVID 19 info Policy and legislative drafting re social security and family assistance is not made in Centrelink but in the Dept of Social Services Read all about the details here Coronavirus COVID 19 information and support Useful Info For Claims Newstart claim go through each question and the checklist at the end carefully Get all your paperwork in order and scan or photograph your documents to produce decent quality uploads to make it easier for the staff to process your claim BTW a blurry photo that s mostly dark grey or a photo that s huge or tiny is kind is a shitty thing to upload So please try and read your photos before you upload them If at all possible turning your uploads into PDFs makes things easier on everyone Similarly changing the file names for your uploads to describe contents Surname ID Date will help Some of the information you would normally see below need would include ID including showing residence details eg passport with visa if you have it recent employment information if you are applying because of recent income loss perhaps try and get something from your employer in writing about lack of work etc if this is easy enough to get I would do it for no other reason as it will give you evidence for your future CV If you re still working recent payslips if you re not working employment separation certificates evidence of every source of income such as recent payslips or if self employed your last tax return you might need to do an estimated profit and loss statement if you don t have a tax return statements and bank balances for all of your bank accounts info about any shares you own remember those Telstra amp amp amp amp IAG shares You will need the ASX code and number of shares you hold if you pay rent a rent certificate it recent lease if you have a partner you also have to provide details for them incl ID and all income and asset info NB a lot of verification requirements are going to be waived during the crisis so don t despair if you can t get certain documents Why claims processing can take weeks Skipping information or not providing everything you need wastes so much time It will delay your claim and drive you and the Centrelink staff who will be inundated mad The easier you can make it to approve the claim the quicker it can be processed If you re not uploading something because it s a bit hard to find something it means that someone will have to send a letter or make a call while there s another 100 claims are waiting That takes time and may not happen days after the person decided they could get no further with your claim Then when you provide the information your claim will not be able to be picked up immediately because there s another 100 who also had to bring more stuff So suck it up and get your shit together Time to adult How to help reduce call wait times if at all possible check online info before you call have ID paper and pen ready to take notes Don t start calls with complaints about Centrelink wait times government personal history of shitty things you had to go through to get help If 50 000 people reduce their calls by cutting out 30s of chitchat that s 400 h of talk time or 50 extra staff working an 8 hr day answering calls Be ready with CRN if you have one name DOB address and other ID explain clearly why you are calling Am I eligible for I want to claim I want to check my rate I want a review of my decision listen carefully and repeat back what you think you re being told so officers can assess whether they have understood you and you have understood them if you receive more than one payment ask whether info applies to all the payments you receive if you are calling for another relative or friend and they have not completed a nominee form or are not a partner who has specifically authorised Centrelink to talk to you they must be sitting next to you be able to identify themselves and be able to give permission for an officer to talk to you Above all be mindful that Centrelink staff deal with distressed people in crisis all day If you re angry it kicks in people s defense mechanisms making
