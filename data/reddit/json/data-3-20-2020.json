Geographical factors high LA San Francisco New York City to low Alaska Middle America population density and number of overseas visitors Many international and open land routes Hope you find this useful and something to think about Summarising the above and observing what s happening in the real world in my humble opinion high vigilance low overseas visitors and low religiosity seems to be the biggest factor as whether a country gets control of the initial attempts for the Virus to spread Receptiveness to authoritative control religiosity again then determines how quickly the country regains control after the initial spread Again this is my informed opinion feel free to disagree with my observation above You may consider applying these observations to your own individual circumstances community etc Looking at the above it s not really looking good for USA France UK at this moment Thanks for reading the wall of text", "score": "26", "time": "2020-03-21 01:18:40"},

the true infection rate because we started testing way too late and we re only testing a small group of people that meet the criteria 2 We do know an average percentage of deaths caused by Covid 19 based on combined data of other countries that are ahead of us 3 We do know approximately how long it takes from the time of infection to the time of recovery or death 4 Since we can t know the true infection rate based on current test reports we can look at the number of deaths and work backwards to determine what the infection rate was for the past couple months and also predict what the future will look like Based on the above information we can look at the case fatality rate in the U S so far and determine that there were at least 1 6 million people infected with SARS CoV 2 around mid March in the United States When this thesis was published on March 20th Dogan predicted that there would be around 800 deaths in the United States by the 26th Today is the 26th and we re close to 1 100 deaths He was being conservative in his estimations which is probably why we re at a higher number today We know that the number of deaths are doubling every 3 days If the average time from infection to recovery or death is 24 days then we should expect the number of deaths to continue to climb and then start to peak 24 days after the start of the quarantine Considering schools and businesses began closing around March 14th here in the U S that should put the start of the peak of the curve and the death rate at approximately 30 000 35 000 deaths around April 7 10 This model also shows that it is highly likely that millions of us have already been infected which means we will have established herd immunity much sooner than we thought But you re not allowed to say that because of all the stupid people that will read that and decide that it s ok to go be with Amanda Huginkiss again If you take this information as justification for fewer quarantine restrictions right now I give you an F for reading comprehension At most this means that places that haven t started to quarantine yet are screwed unless they start soon and those of us that have locked ourselves down already
