extraordinary good healthcare I have worked in Italy UK and Aus and don t make the mistake to think that what is happening is happening in a 3rd world country 3 The current situation is difficult to imagine and numbers do not explain things at all Our hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid 19 they are running 200 capacity 4 We ve stopped all routine all ORs have been converted to ITUs and they are now diverting or not treating all other emergencies like trauma or strokes There are hundreds of pts with severe resp failure and many of them do not have access to anything above a reservoir mask 5 Patients above 65 or younger with comorbidities are not even assessed by ITU I am not saying not tubed I m saying not assessed and no ITU staff attends when they arrest Staff are working as much as they can but they are starting to get sick and are emotionally overwhelmed 6 My friends call me in tears because they see people dying in front of them and they con only offer some oxygen Ortho and pathologists are being given a leaflet and sent to see patients on NIV PLEASE STOP READ THIS AGAIN AND THINK 7 We have seen the same pattern in different areas a week apart and there is no reason that in a few weeks it won t be the same everywhere this is the pattern 8 1 A few positive cases first mild measures people are told to avoid ED but still hang out in groups everyone says not to panick 2 Some moderate resp failures and a few severe ones that need tube but regular access to ED is significantly reduced so everything looks great 9 3 Tons of patients with moderate resp failure that overtime deteriorate to saturate ICUs first then NIVs then CPAP hoods then even O2 4 Staff gets sick so it gets difficult to cover for shifts mortality spikes also from all other causes that can t be treated properly 10 Everything about how to treat them is online but the only things that will make a difference are do not be afraid of massively strict measures to keep people safe 11 if governments won t do this at least keep your family safe your loved ones with history of cancer or diabetes or any transplant will not be tubed if they need it even if they are young By safe I mean YOU do not attend them and YOU decide who does and YOU teach them how to 12 Another typical attitude is read and listen to people saying things like this and think that s bad dude and then go out for dinner

basically being given a get out of jail free card on the economic fallout that s happening and he s ripping it up because he s the one who keeps bringing up the economy and how important it is Right

to wreck a lot of shit America needs a leader that will see us through the storm first and then focus on rebuilding Right now Trump doesn t care about what is going to happen during the storm at all he wants to pretend it away and focus on rebuilding before it even hits Is the economy a consideration right now Sure however all focus needs to be right now on mitigation and treatment FEMA needs to be building hospitals and organizing medical response The US government needs to make sure that there s food supplies and medicine readily available to all parts of the country The money doesn t need to be put into tax cuts or rebuilding right now it needs to be put into making sure people who are effected get necessities taken care of until they re back on their feet We need a leader who values

Italy Dr Daniele Macchini Read until the end I found it chilling from a few days ago things are worse now After much thought about whether and what to write about what is happening to us I felt that silence was not responsible I will therefore try to convey to people far from our reality what we are living in Bergamo in these days of Covid 19 pandemic I understand the need not to create panic but when the message of the dangerousness of what is happening does not reach people I shudder I myself watched with some amazement the reorganization of the entire hospital in the past week when our current enemy was still in the shadows the wards slowly emptied elective activities were interrupted intensive care were freed up to create as many beds as possible All this rapid transformation brought an atmosphere of silence and surreal emptiness to the corridors of the hospital that we did not yet understand waiting for a war that was yet to begin and that many including me were not so sure would ever come with such ferocity I still remember my night call a week ago when I was waiting for the results of a swab When I think about it my anxiety over one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified now that I ve seen what s happening Well the situation now is dramatic to say the least The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night But now that need for beds has arrived in all its drama One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace The boards with the names of the patients of different colours depending on the operating unit are now all red and instead of surgery you see the diagnosis which is always the damned same bilateral interstitial pneumonia An epidemiological disaster is taking place And there are no more surgeons urologists orthopedists we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us Cases are multiplying we arrive at a rate of 15 20 admissions per day all for the same reason The results of the swabs now come one after the other positive positive positive Suddenly the E R is collapsing Reasons for the access always the same fever and breathing difficulties fever and cough respiratory failure Radiology reports always the same bilateral interstitial pneumonia bilateral interstitial pneumonia bilateral interstitial pneumonia All to be hospitalized Someone already to be intubated and go to intensive care For others it s too late Every ventilator becomes like gold those in operating theatres that have now suspended their non urgent activity become intensive care places that did not exist before The staff is exhausted I saw the tiredness on faces that didn t know what it was despite the already exhausting workloads they had I saw a solidarity of all of us who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask what can I do for you now Doctors who move beds and transfer patients who administer therapies instead of nurses Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can t save everyone and the vital parameters of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny There are no more shifts no more hours Social life is suspended for us We no longer see our families for fear of infecting them Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols Some of our colleagues who are infected also have infected relatives and some of their relatives are already struggling between life and death So be patient you can t go to the theatre museums or the gym Try to have pity on the myriad of old people you could exterminate We just try to make ourselves useful You should do the same we influence the life and death of a few dozen people You with yours many
