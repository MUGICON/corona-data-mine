If you are not, ""Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.""",0,2020-02-28T15:13:49.000Z

Canadians are a very robust people who never practice running to the doctor for the sniffles or cough, we head to the pharmacy to load up on over the counter helps.  By the time we are too sick, we will have infected many around us.  
Most of us have been diligent to educate ourselves with information from Infectious disease doctors internationally and international news coverage on the matter.....instead of the negligent Canadian government news babble.
Because the news in Canada has been shrouded in negligence and non transparency in reporting, the most vulnerable among us have not been given the opportunity to adequately prepare.  
Healthcare workers on the frontline in China with full hazmat gear have been contracting this virus and even dying.  With the lack of protective masks in Canada....what will the vulnerable public do?
Why must you learn from experience and not global observation?
