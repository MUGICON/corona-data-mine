51,Amy Knorr,"It is my statement that Lisa Bullock, Jennifer Meagher and Polita Barnes formally Peggy Rissotti, had an assignment for Russia, to work toward shielding information to and from Amy Knorr, myself, all of my life from my birth on June 22, 1968 until present.

Target information: the Ulster NatWest Vault account, Donald Knorr's Will, The National Trust, the Royal Public Compensation Program, any proposed entertainment projects, especially the documentary series, the Royal Family, any proposed vocational plans in government, my government reports, information about Mata Hari.

The goals: facilitate theft of my vault account, creative ideas, vocational plans, compensation program business properties, halt and block the documentary series, make future Royal plans without Amy Knorr.

Required to complete the process: the death of Amy Knorr.

Brad Knorr planned to do a documentary about Pygmalion.

Matt Lukin is the one with the information about the bloodline of Ville Valo losing his St. Louis Senate idea to Polita Barnes' bloodline. Matt Lukin planned to do a documentary about St Louis during the reign of Marie Antoinette.

Dan Peters had a finished proposal for Llewellyn the Great.

Amy Knorr, myself, in addition to previously submitted documentary subjects, wanted to work on the introduction to Egyptian Latin as the written and spoken language of Egypt.

""Island Magic"" anchored islands; Bermuda, Haiti, Manhattan...

I also plan: The Hudson Expedition, Kuan Yin's Mongolia, Versailles, Food documentaries.

Celine Dion wanted to work on a documentary about Wales.

Millie Bobbybrown and others wanted to work on a documentary about the Pennsylvania Dutch, as well as the Royal Family's contributions across America.

Many signed up for the project.

The Nigerian mafia had been working with Russia in the murder plot against Marilyn Monroe.

The old Nigerian underworld is now part of the American underworld.

JFK was the Ancient World Fixed Twin Soul of Marilyn Monroe, parted 2600 years ago.

Sylvia Plath had been their bloodline daughter.

If Nigeria was working to finish the job against Amy Knorr, bloodline descendant of Marilyn, then the American underworld, which infiltrates the American government, is helping Russia in the murder plot against Amy Knorr.

Other American underworld operatives: Roxanne CNA of Country Villa, Patricia of Budapest, Eric Wilson of Sublime.
