0,Raihannah Taylor,"For years many people in my community in the United States have asked for the return of factories and the reduction of automated machines. It's not only a concern regarding layoffs, loss of wages, and productivity, for many people who were once employed through industry, but about creating local jobs and having the ability to ""reopen"" or ""bring back"" factories where citizens once made products for the country they lived in.
Thinking back to the 1950's where cars, household products, beauty products, food supply, and small business thrived in local communities creating an economic boom in the United States helped this country thrive into a world power.
Yes, most of the world power was due to the success of winning of World War II, however, the United States made and produced its own products and wealth for many years until the business deals with China. Many factories were shut down, many communities had to find jobs in the city if they were from rural areas, and the education and skill requirements had completely changed.
In summary and to explain my point, with China being the #1 country to produce and create many products that citizens in the United States use, we have destroyed our own local businesses and factories and put so much into the cheap labor that China produces. The big businesses in the United States are cheap and have no regard for quality only quantity, putting all there eggs in China.
Now we're all feeling the affects of it through COVID-19 and the basket has cracked.",0,2020-03-02T10:46:57.000Z

5,Mr. C,"actually if its airborne and can breed in the air and if any planes had the exterior infected with the virus it could be breeding in the jet streams already which I fricken hope not but it is possible as people have been speculating it is airborne and aerosol which I think aerosol means it does not need a water droplet to transfer, then with rain/snow or any other weather system dust etc it will spread everywhere not much can be done but stockpile supplies if that is the case. I hope not but that is what my foresight says. I hope I am wrong I hope it is not airborne if it is they already effected everyone it's just a matter of time, well actually depending on the way the jetstream travels there would be potential safe zones but that's not considering birds and bugs carrying the virus so nvm actually. Get a mask while you can is what I think also get cans of soup and watnot. Eventually immunity will build in survivors and you may all survive. I'm type one diabetic so I'll prob die which sucks but not much I can do but try to prepare my family and people that will listen. I have high immunity to diseases though and my type one diabeties was causes by my own immune system attacking my islet cells they may have of been cancerous..so I may survive. We shall see *sigh* prepare better off to get ready for the worst and hope for the best. God bless I hope I'm wrong and I hope its not airborne/aerosol and I hope that is just pure speculation. Dont expect your leaders to tell you that they cant think like that. It's not their fault for not having that kind of foresight I have not seen anyone else say that either. All we can do is try to help each other survive",0,2020-02-23T06:52:32.000Z

10,marco michele sp 1981,"finchè restiamo in una Repubblica PARLAMENTARE ritengo illegittimo e arbitrario il fatto che i Governatori si attribuiscano (o assumano dovendo supplire a negligenze altrui) l'onere di limitare e sospendere le libertà costotuzionali dei cittadini. Se la ssanità è competenza delle regioni, la gestione di epidemie e potenziali emergenze umanitarie come quest non è loro competenza costituzionale.


Si tratta di un abuso che l'urgenza e l'unità nazionale non possono giustificare, perchè creerebbe il primo precedente dal dopoguerra.


Abbiamo sentito parlare dell'azione del Governo e di una Protezione Civile incapace e inetta nel risolvere i terremoti dell'Aquila, dell'Umbria, delle Marche e di Amatrice, alal quale ora si affida anche la gestione dell'emergenza sanitaria.


Se la diffusione del virus continua, dovrà essere coinvolto anche l'Esercito. Perchè il Parlamento non costituisce un comitato interpalrmamentare di sorveglianze con pieni poteri di sipezione e controllo? Perchè non si impone al Governo Conte di nominar eun referente unico dellEsecutivo che informi il Parlamento sulla gestione dell'emergenza? Perchè il Presidente Mattarella non è coinvolto e non siede al tavolo dell'unità di crisi?",0,2020-02-22T13:49:36.000Z

Cause at some point in the future, another virus will appear.. It might be somewhat expensive to give such a box to everyone, but it could drastically lower the number of infected people who needs medical care.. cause guess what.. In a hospital, the staff has to go through multiple masks to treat the infected ones anyway, so more infected means more masks used, also.. the doctors needs payment, and more people infected means more death and a harder time to contain it, among alot of other stuff.. also, if everyone had masks already, the demand wouldnt be so high, meaning that whenever the next virus hits, hospitals would have all the masks they needed, instead of a shortage..

So yeah.. The box citizens could recieve could have a box of masks, a paper about virus/bacteria facts, a guideline on how and when to use the masks, and maybe some hand sanitizer and other stuff aswell.",0,2020-02-21T08:56:05.000Z
