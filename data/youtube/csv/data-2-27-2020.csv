41,Gary Lewis,"16:00 I was at the Hong Kong air port in 2013 a small baby was crawling towards a hand railing. It was a 50ft drop to the floor below. The baby was crawing through the handrailing. Luckly the mother grabbed her baby just in time. I was a few feet behind her. 
It was a no child proof  handrailing. Horizontal bars not vertical bars spacing should have been 4in. Horizontal bars are NO good, because children play and they use them as a ladder. The ergonomic standards may be different on ships then on land  (the national building code may not apply on ships.) This guy's lawer should investigate. An engineer told me when he saw the movie ""Titanic"" Jack at the bow was standing on one of these horizontal rugs of the handrail when he said ""Im king of the world"" my engineer friend said to me ""if i designed a handrailing like that id get fired""",0,2020-02-28T16:50:31.000Z
