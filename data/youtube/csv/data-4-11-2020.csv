11,Abdulrahman X,"Common sense. When someone is sick. Flu, Cold, fever, etc... Stay home, rest and get better.

Why is the Co - Virus so different? 

People are being ignorant. 
If someone is sick. Stay home or go to doctor. 

The Co - Virus = a battle of cleanliness VS. uncleanliness.

Shouldn't we always maintain cleanliness and good hygiene? Regardless of Co - Virus.",0,2020-04-11T05:10:59.000Z

17,Rajesh Pandya,"Even after so much knowledge of virulence power, pathogenicity, and difficulty to control disease, people do not understand seriousness , they are burying dead bodies in land and not creamting dead bodies in fire.





People and regulatory bodies must understand control procedures, post death of patient.

Puting dead bodies in earth is high risk for future, as there will be many more mutations in each body and we may have 1000's of different varieties of these virus.





Do we have smart epidemiologists and virologists? to persuade government to enforce policies to dispose dead bodies of such massive attack?",0,2020-04-11T04:29:59.000Z

I would fear for my life if i lived in a state where the governor invites people for drinks the night before the quarantine and congregating is somehow essential.

That being said our President is the leading cause of death in America and continues to dismantle the CDC as of February, look at his budget, see for yourself.

Together with other factors, the team reported being able to predict risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with up to 80% accuracy.""

So, they wind up with ARDS and ARDS is treated with phlebotomy.

“Phlebotomy was done to remove 10% of total blood volume. Symptomatic improvement was dramatic.”
