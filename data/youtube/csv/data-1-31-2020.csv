18,Beautiful Chaos,"contagious while asymptomatic, in incubation, AND in sequelae that is what is so scary! Its been reported from within Wuhan that 5 million people left the city the day before lockdown ( following the Chinese New Year)... so the numbers they are reporting of people who could be  infectious, is EXTREMELY conservative. Its probably closer to 300,000 +. Major dishonesty in reporting.. this began in early DECEMBER and was shut up!!  This virus could hold through MAY before the PEAK!! And the big QUESTION, is it true there is a human manipulation aspect within the virus, and has it been manipulated with something that will come back around months from now... I heard someone speculate it could possibly be  injected with HIV??? ALSO was this potentially released on purpose as opposed to coming from BATS in the meat market? This virus is doubling every 6 days in number of REPORTED cases with every single infected person, passing it to at least 2 people.. not counting who you could still be infecting AFTER you are feeling well... SO MANY QUESTIONS... people should be educating the public on measures to take NOW  that will help.. like ascorbic acid, iodine rubbed in nostrils... oscillococcinum. But the most important thing is that THEY SHOULD BE HONEST IN THEIR REPORTING, third world countries will not survive this if we cannot get all the CLEAR FACTS!! AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY doing the best thing for AMERICA with  TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS!!",0,2020-02-04T20:25:44.000Z

What makes it even worse is the fact that they are arresting their citizens who have been telling the truth about the actual number of cases of infected in that country, probably well over 100,000 people. The Chinese government has claimed this virus started in a food market, but don't be surprised if the Chinese government weaponized this virus intentionally  to not only divert attention from the uprising of their own population that is fighting for freedom and Capitalism, but knowing that this virus would intentionally spread throughout the world with the intention of not only infecting people in other countries, but negatively impacting the economies of other countries...specifically trying to halt the US economy. A downward turn in the strong US economy could have an impact on who gets elected as President in November. And I have no doubt that China would go to any extent to stop the US from electing the current President again, who has held China accountable for their unfair trade agreements in the past with the US and has currently cost China billions of dollars for their economy.",0,2020-02-02T15:15:25.000Z
