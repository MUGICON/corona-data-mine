It's not only a concern regarding layoffs, loss of wages, and productivity, for many people who were once employed through industry, but about creating local jobs and having the ability to \"reopen\" or \"bring back\" factories where citizens once made products for the country they lived in.\nThinking back to the 1950's where cars, household products, beauty products, food supply, and small business thrived in local communities creating an economic boom in the United States helped this country thrive into a world power.\nYes, most of the world power was due to the success of winning of World War II, however, the United States made and produced its own products and wealth for many years until the business deals with China. Many factories were shut down, many communities had to find jobs in the city if they were from rural areas, and the education and skill requirements had completely changed.\nIn summary and to explain my point, with China being the #1 country to produce and create many products that citizens in the United States use, we have destroyed our own local businesses and factories and put so much into the cheap labor that China produces. The big businesses in the United States are cheap and have no regard for quality only quantity, putting all there eggs in China.\nNow we're all feeling the affects of it through COVID-19 and the basket has cracked.", "score": "0", "time": "2020-03-02T10:46:57.000Z"}, {"author": "James Snider", "content": "You need a PM with backbone...

I hope not but that is what my foresight says. I hope I am wrong I hope it is not airborne if it is they already effected everyone it's just a matter of time, well actually depending on the way the jetstream travels there would be potential safe zones but that's not considering birds and bugs carrying the virus so nvm actually. Get a mask while you can is what I think also get cans of soup and watnot. Eventually immunity will build in survivors and you may all survive. I'm type one diabetic so I'll prob die which sucks but not much I can do but try to prepare my family and people that will listen. I have high immunity to diseases though and my type one diabeties was causes by my own immune system attacking my islet cells they may have of been cancerous..so I may survive. We shall see *sigh* prepare better off to get ready for the worst and hope for the best. God bless I hope I'm wrong and I hope its not airborne/aerosol and I hope that is just pure speculation.
