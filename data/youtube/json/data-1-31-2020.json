Its probably closer to 300,000 +. Major dishonesty in reporting.. this began in early DECEMBER and was shut up!!  This virus could hold through MAY before the PEAK!! And the big QUESTION, is it true there is a human manipulation aspect within the virus, and has it been manipulated with something that will come back around months from now... I heard someone speculate it could possibly be  injected with HIV??? ALSO was this potentially released on purpose as opposed to coming from BATS in the meat market? This virus is doubling every 6 days in number of REPORTED cases with every single infected person, passing it to at least 2 people.. not counting who you could still be infecting AFTER you are feeling well... SO MANY QUESTIONS... people should be educating the public on measures to take NOW  that will help.. like ascorbic acid, iodine rubbed in nostrils... oscillococcinum.
